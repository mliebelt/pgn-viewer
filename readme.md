# Pgn Viewer JS

Pgn Viewer JS is a simple JavaScript implementation to show PGN files (Portable Game Notation == Chess)
in a web page. PgnViewerJS does not write everything anew, but it uses the following libraries:

* [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) Base library to model chess in JavaScript
* [Chessground](https://github.com/ornicar/chessground) The chessboard used by lichess.org
* [pegjs](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs) Parser Generator implemented in Javascript.

See the section Acknowledgments for more supporting libraries.

See the working examples on my new GitHub Pages site [PgnViewerJS](http://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/), especially the [Configuration Builder](http://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/config/config.html) that demonstrates all parameters in a running example.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to use it is to install it by using NPM: `npm install @mliebelt/pgn-viewer`. You will find there the diretory `lib` that contains everything. Copy that onto your webserver.

### Example Screenshots

The following are example screenshots with the configuration set below, to show the rich possibilities of PgnViewerJS.

![Theme Sportverlag](screenshots/sportverlag.png)
![Edit with variations](screenshots/edit-variation.png)
![Viewer](screenshots/view-layout-left.png)

The screenshots show from left to right:

* `mode: board; theme: sportverlag; pieceStyle: uscf`
* `mode: edit; orientation: black; locale: de` with comments
* `mode: view; layout: 'left'` with comments

Go to the [github.io pages](http://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/) (documentation), where the current (and former) versions are available.

### Features

This implementation has the following features:

* Allows to show one chess game complete, with a lot of different styles, themes, tuning, ...
* Allows to play through the games forward and backward, including variations.
* Allows to play from a legal position only legal moves, and adds these moves to the notation (in a different style)
* Allows to play through by
  * clicking on moves
  * clicking on next and previous button
  * clicking on play button
  * using cursor left and right on the keyboard
* Allows to add moves to a game, when in the right 'mode'.
* Knows all PGN notation elements, and knows how to render them.

### UI modes

There are four different kind of usages:

* `PGNV.pgnView` renders the whole game, and allows to play it through, jump to any position.
* `PGNV.pgnEdit` is a superset of pgnView, that allows to additional add variations, change the order of main line and variations, and allows all other kind of interactions that are possible: adding comments, PGN notation elements, whatever.
* `PGNV.pgnBoard` will just show a position without any interaction possible.
* `PGNV.pgnPrint` will just show a whole chess game, without any interaction possible.

There is at the moment no way to save a game that was edited in `pgnEdit` mode. But you may at least copy the whole notation, and insert it again in the HTML code of your web page.

## Running the tests

* Run `npm test`. This runs the tests for the module `pgn-reader`.

## Deployment

### From Release

* Copy the files from directory `lib` into a web server.
* Create new HTML files with the corresponding head and body.

### From Clone

* Clone the repository.
* Run `npm install` from the root, to ensure are tools are installed.
* Run `npm build` to both modules (first pgn-reader, then pgn-viewer) build a distribution.
* Copy the files from the directory `modules/pgn-viewer/lib`.
* Create new HTML files with the corresponding head and body.

### About handling of assets

Due to the fact that Webpack holds the assets under a given directory (in my case, it is `/lib/`). If you deploy the PgnViewerJS under any different root path, you have to define that root path by providing a Javascript line before loading the library:

     <script>__globalCustomDomain = '/PgnViewerJS/js/';</script>
     <script src="/PgnViewerJS/js/pgnv.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

### Using the viewer

To use the viewer in an HTML page, you have to do the following steps:

* Include the necessary library `pgnv.js` and the corresponding resources `locales` and `pgnv-assets`.
* Have Fontawesome referenced.
* Include the necessary div container for rendering of the  board and the moves.
* Include JavaScript code inside your HTML page to call the viewer.

So a rough template will look like:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
        <head>
            <script src="js/pgnv.js" type="text/javascript" ></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="board"></div>
            <script>
                PGNV.pgnView('board',{ pgn: '1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5', pieceStyle: 'merida' });
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/mliebelt/PgnViewerJS/tags).

From the version 1.0.0 on, the whole package can be downloaded / installed by using NPM:

* Download: `npm pack @mliebelt/pgn-viewer` Results in download of a file `mliebelt-pgn-viewer-1.3.0.tgz`, that contains in the directory `package/lib` all resources needed.
* Install: `npm install @mliebelt/pgn-viewer` as part of some other application. You will find then the files in the directory `node_modules/@mliebelt/pgn-viewer/lib`.
