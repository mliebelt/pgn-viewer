# PgnViewerJS

PgnViewerJS is a simple JavaScript implementation to show PGN files (Portable Game Notation == Chess)
in a web page. PgnViewerJS does not write everything anew, but it uses the following libraries:


See the working examples on my new GitHub Pages site [PgnViewerJS](http://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/), especially the [Configuration Builder](http://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/docu/example/config.html) that demonstrates all parameters in a running example.
## Getting Started

The easiest way to use it is to download a release, unpack that release, copy one of the examples HTLM files in `examples` (depending which mode you want to use), and modify them to your liking.

### Example Screenshots

The following are example screenshots with the configuration set below, to show the rich possibilities of PgnViewerJS.

<img src="img/screenshots/sportverlag.png" style="text-align: top;"> <img src="img/screenshots/view-with-fen.png" width="250px" style="text-align: top"> <img src="img/screenshots/edit-variation.png" width="200px">

The screenshots show from left to right:

* `mode: board; theme: sportverlag; pieceStyle: uscf`
* `mode: view; showNotation: false; showFen: true` with comment
* `mode: edit; orientation: black; locale: de` with comments

Go to the [github.io pages](http://mliebelt.github.io/PgnViewerJS/) (documentation), where the current (and former) versions will be available.


### Features

This implementation has the following features:

* Allows to show one chess game complete, with a lot of different styles, themes, tuning, ...
* Allows to play through the games forward and backward, including variations.
* Allows to play from a legal position only legal moves, and adds these moves to the notation (in a different style)
* Allows to play through by
  * clicking on moves
  * clicking on next and previous button
  * clicking on play button
  * using cursor left and right on the keyboard
* Allows to add moves to a game, when in the right 'mode'.  
* Knows all PGN notation elements, and knows how to render them.  

### UI modes

There are four different kind of usages:

* pgnView renders the whole game, and allows to play it through, jump to any position.
* pgnEdit is a superset of pgnView, that allows to additional add variations,
change the order of main line and variations, and allows all other kind of
interactions that are possible: adding comments, PGN notation elements, whatever.
* pgnBoard will just show a position without any interaction possible.
* pgnPrint will just show a whole chess game, without any interaction possible.

There is at the moment no way to save a game that was edited in `pgnEdit` mode. But
you may at least copy the whole notation, and insert it again in the HTML code of
your web page.

## Running the tests

* Clone the repository.
* Open the file `test/SpecRunner.html` and see if some tests break.

## Deployment

### From Release

* Copy the files from a release into a web server.
* Create new HTML files with the corresponding head and body.

### From Clone

* Clone the repository.
* Run `npm install` from the root, to ensure are tools are installed.
* Run `grunt default` to build a distribution.
* Copy the files from the directory `dist` (or `dist-nojq` for a variation without jQuery included).
* Create new HTML files with the corresponding head and body.

### Using the viewer

To use the viewer in an HTML page, you have to do the following steps:

* Include the necessary libraries.
* Include the necessary CSS files.
* Include the necessary div container for rendering of the 
   board and the moves.
* Include JavaScript code inside your HTML page to call the viewer.
   
So a rough template will look like:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
        <head>
            <link href="dist/css/pgnvjs.css" rel="stylesheet">
            <script src="dist/js/pgnviewerjs.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="board"></div>
            <script>
                pgnView('board',{ pgn: '1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5', pieceStyle: 'merida' });
            </script>   
        </body>
    </html>

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/mliebelt/PgnViewerJS/tags).

Because not all people want to build on themselves, I keep the versions available for downloads:
