## Summary

[pgn-viewer](https://github.com/mliebelt/pgn-viewer) allows to display chess games in various ways. The distribution (where this readme is a part of) contains all necessary files to integrate the viewer into your web application. To demonstrate the usage, the files  in the directory `examples` are included as well. So for a start, you may use the four examples to see the difference in the four modes:

* [Board](board.html): Just display a chess board
* [View](view.html): Allow to view a chess game, play the moves
* [Print](print.html): Gives a print representation with multiple boards in it, but no interactive view
* [Edit](edit.html): A variant to `View` that even allows to adapt the games (not finished yet).
* [Puzzle](puzzle.html): Lets you guess the next move

See the documentation of the current version on [github pages](http://mliebelt.github.io/pgn-viewer/) for examples, documentation of the API and some background.
