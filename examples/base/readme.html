    <h1>Summary</h1>

<a href="https://github.com/mliebelt/pgn-viewer">pgn-viewer</a> allows to display chess games in various ways. The distribution (where this readme is a part of) contains all necessary files to integrate the viewer into your web application. To demonstrate the usage, the files in the directory examples are included as well. So for a start, you may use the four examples to see the difference in the four modes:

<ul>
    <li><a href="board.html">Board</a>:
        Just display a chess board</li>
    <li><a href="view.html">View</a>:
        Allow to view a chess game, play the moves</li>
    <li><a href="print.html">Print</a>:
        Gives a print representation with multiple boards in it, but no interactive view</li>
    <li><a href="edit.html">Edit</a>:
        A variant to View that even allows to adapt the games (not finished yet).</li>
    <li><a href="puzzle.html">Puzzle</a>:
        Lets you guess the next move .</li>
</ul>

See the documentation of the current version on <a href="http://mliebelt.github.io/pgn-viewer/">github pages</a>
 for examples, documentation of the API and some background.
