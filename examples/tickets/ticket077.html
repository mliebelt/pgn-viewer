    Give the user the configuration to redefine the localPath (or variants of it). Demonstrates this by  redefining some of the buttons. So by hovering over the button, you see that a different localization is used in this example only.</p>
    <div>You have to redefine the locales paths before calling `pgnAny`, because this is done during initialization of the whole thing. So it is included in the head of this example, please have a look at the source code. To test it, I had to disable caching, to see an effect on this. So if you want to see that as well, disable it as well.</div>
