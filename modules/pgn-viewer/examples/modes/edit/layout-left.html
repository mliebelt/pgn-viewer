    let pgn = '{ French Defence Wilhelm Steinitz, the great German Chess Master was officially recognized as the first World Chess Champion after he defeated Johannes Zukertort in 1886 in a 20 games match. Steinitz laid the basis for the scientific theory of chess. He paid much attention to weak and strong points and the accumulation of small positional advantages. He clearly revealed the flaws of premature attack and made the most of the slightest weakening of a position. He is the author of numerous studies dealing with chess theory. His Modern Chess Instructor (1889) greatly influenced the further development of chess theory.  } 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Nf3 a6 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. Qe2 Nb4 10. Bd2 b5 11. Nd1 Nxd3+ 12. cxd3 Qb6 13. b4 $1 Be7 { If 13. ... Bd4, 14. Rb1 Qa7 (To provide a flight-square for the Bishop.) 15. Nxd4 Qxd4 16. Be3 and black loses his Queen.  } 14. a3 f5 $2  { Now the Black Pawn on e6 is backward. A black piece will be always tied down to the defence of this Pawn. After this move the activity of Black Bishop on c8 is greatly diminished.  } 15. Rc1 Bb7 16. Be3 $1 Qd8 17. Nd4 Nf8 18. O-O h5 { To prevent 19. g4. But this move weakens Black\'s Pawn structure.  } 19. Nc3 Kf7 20. Nb1 g6 { Black wants to move his knight from the passive position. But if 20. ...Nd7, Nxf5 exf5 e6+!. But after Black\'s move all his Pawns are on white squares. So Black has very weak black squares, defended by his Bishop.  } 21. Nd2 Nd7 22. N2b3 Rc8 23. Na5 $1 { A remarkable Knight tour. The Knight is headed for c6, to remove Black\'s only defender of his weak dark squares.  } 23. ...Ba8 { Now Steinitz gives a valuable lesson in exploiting square weaknesses, effective use of open file and Rook on the 7th rank.  } 24. Rxc8 Qxc8 25. Rc1 Qb8 26. Qc2 $1 Bd8 { To prevent penetration to the 7th rank.  } 27. Nac6 { Steinitz wants to eliminate Black\'s only defender of dark squares-the Bishop on d8.  For that he allows a chance to exchange his bad Bishop on a8.  Now if 27. ...Bxc6 28. Qxc6 Nf8 29. Nxe6! Nxe6 30. Qd7+ Be7 31. Rc6! Nf8 32. Rf6+ and White wins.  } 27. ...Qb7 28. Nxd8+ Rxd8 29. Qc7 $1 Qb8 30. Bf2 $1 Qb6 { To prevent 31. Bh4.  } 31. Nf3 Qxc7 32. Rxc7 { White controls the 7th rank which is Rook, his Knight is headed for g5, and his Bishop controls all the Black squares. Black cannot move his Knight because of the Pin, his Rook is tied down to the defence of the Knight and his Bishop has no safe square.  Black must meet the threat of 33. Bh4.  } 32. ...Ke8 33. Ng5 Nf8 34. Bc5 Nd7 { To prevent 35. Re7# } 35. Bd6 $1 { Black is in zugzwang since all legal moves result in drastic material losses.  (a) The King may not move.  (b) The Bishop may move only at the risk of being captured.  (c) The Rook may move to b8, when 36. Rxd7 Kxd7 37. Bxb8 wins a piece for White.  (d) The Knight may move to b6 when 36. Re7+ Kf8 37. Nh7+ Kg8 38. Nf6+ Kf8 39. Rd7#.  } 1-0'
