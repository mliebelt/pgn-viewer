1.b4 
{WHAT?!?! In the true hypermodern style, Tartakower develops a FLANK pawn (!), without probably to allow for the fianchetto of the dark-square Bishop.} 
e6 
{Maroczy (Black) makes an illogical move of his own. He blocks in his without c8-Bishop while allowing his other Bishop to attack the b4-pawn.} 
2.Bb2 
{Tartakower doesn't need to defend the pawn yet (2...Bxb4 3.a3 Be7 gambits a  without pawn for the initiative and a lead in development). He fianchettos the without Bishop in an attempt to control the center rather than occupy without it. } 
Nf6 
{Maroczy follows more conventional lines, developing a Knight toward the without center.} 
3.b5 
{Tartakower inhibits the development of Black's other Knight (by taking away without a6 and c6). } 
d5 
{Maroczy occupies the center with a pawn. Now White's task is to undermine without Black's center.} 
4.e3 
{This move doesn't block anything, since the dark-square Bishop is already without developed. Tartakower's light-square Bishop protects the b-pawn, and the without pawn on e3 prepares the advance of the d-pawn to d4.} 
Be7 
{Maroczy develops his last Kingside minor piece and prepares for castling.} 
5.f4 
{Tartakower pushes this pawn so that he will have total control of the dark without squares in the center and on the Kingside. He wants to be able to safely without post his pieces on these dark squares.} 
O-O 
{Maroczy castles, as expected.} 
6.Bd3 
{Tartakower begins the deployment of his Kingside forces. Maybe e2 would have without been better for the Bishop (since it wouldn't block the d-pawn like it does without on d3).} 
a6 
{Maroczy decides to rid himself of the cramping b-pawn. If White plays 7.bxa6, without Maroczy can recapture with either the Rook or the Knight.} 
7.a4 
{Tartakower wants to maintain a cramping pawn on b5, so he defends it with without another pawn (7...axb5 8.axb5).} 
axb5 
{Maroczy captures the pesky pawn...} 
8.axb5 
{...and Tartakower recaptures, maintaining a cramping pawn on b5.} 
Rxa1 
{Maroczy has no choice but to trade Rooks (there was no way to defend the Rook without on a8, and he had no protected square to move it to).} 
9.Bxa1 
{Of course, Tartakower recaptures to maintain the material balance.} 
Nbd7 
{Maroczy really doesn't want to block in his c8-Bishop, but he really has no without choice. The only safe square for his Queenside minor pieces is d7. One or without the other has to move there.} 
10.Nf3 
{Tartakower develops his Kingside Knight, which now eyes e5 (Ne5 Nxe5, fxe5 -- without threatening Black's f6-Knight and opening the f-file for White's without Rook). } 
Ne4 
{Maroczy beats White to the draw. The Black Knight leaps into the center. Now without if 11.Bxe4, ...dxe4 menaces the White f3-Knight and give Black the without initiative.} 
11.O-O 
{Tartakower castles, removing his King from the center (which was getting kind without of drafty).} 
f5 
{Maroczy fortifies his e4-Knight and stakes his claim to the light squares.} 
12.Be2 
{The Bishop retreats a step to allow the d-pawn to advance to d3, kicking out without the Knight.} 
Nd6 
{Maroczy voluntarily retreats the Knight (instead of waiting to be forced into without it).} 
13.Qc1 
{Tartakower predicts that Black will try to sieze the long a1-h8 diagonal with without ...Bf6. He moves the Queen over one square so that he can meet Black's without Bishop move with Bb2.} 
Bf6 
{Maroczy's Bishop grabs the long diagonal as predicted.} 
14.Na3 
{Tartakower sees another way to defend the Bishop (and develops a piece at the without same time). The Knight move makes it possible for the White Queen to guard without the Bishop (but is the Knight well-placed on a3?).} 
c6 
{Maroczy will now remove the annoying b5-pawn once and for all...} 
15.bxc6 
{If one of your pawns is attacked by an opposing pawn, capturing is usually without the way to go. Your opponent must recapture to keep the material even, and without this hands you the initiative).} 
bxc6 
{Maroczy has to recapture (if he moves the Knight, he winds up a pawn down without after 16.cxb7 Bxb7).} 
16.Ne5 
{Now Tartakower makes his bid for central domination. He begins by offering a without trade. How should Maroczy capture the invading Knight?} 
Bxe5 
{Maroczy decides to give up his "bad" BIshop and keep both of his Knights without (after all, this IS a closed position, and Knights are better than Bishops without in closed positions).} 
17.fxe5 
{Recapturing with the pawn (rather than with the diagonal-controlling Bishop) without makes sense.} 
Nf7 
{17...Nxe5 is clearly impossible (due to 18.Bxe5), so the menaced Black Knight without retreats. Now the e5-pawn is attacked twice and only defended once. What's without the best move for White? } 
18.d4 
{Of course. Now the e5-pawn is totally safe, and White has a possible outpost without square on d6. This is what Tartakower envisioned when he played 16.Ne5.} 
Ng5 
{Maroczy maneuvers his Knight closer to the White position. Most likely he without intends to re-establish his Knight outpost on e4.} 
19.c4 
{Tartakower proposes to break up Black's central pawn structure. He also without prevents Black from doing the same to him with c6-c5.} 
Ba6 
{Maroczy skewers the attacking White c-pawn, preventing it from capturing on without d5 (20.cxd5 Bxe2, and Black wins a piece!). } 
20.Re1 
{By defending his Bishop, Tartakower renews the threat of cxd5.} 
Qa8 
{The Queen defends the Black Bishop. Now if White plays cxd5, Black can without immediately recapture the White pawn without worries of White's Bxa6.} 
21.Bc3 
{Tartakower jockeys toward a future Bb4, striking at the Black Rook.} 
Rb8 
{Maroczy siezes the open file and keeps the White Bishop off of without b4. } 
22.Qc2 
{Tartakower plans on opening the c-file with cxd5. He advances the Queen in without preparation for playing Rc1, doubling his forces on the soon-to-be-opened without file. } 
Ne4 
{Maroczy gets his Knight to a great central square, from which it controls without plenty of territory on White's half of the board. } 
23.Bd3 
{The e4-square can't be attacked by a White pawn, so Tartakower must use a without piece to get the Black Knight off of e4.} 
Rb7 
{Maroczy may be thinking of doubling his heavy pieces on the b-file (once the without situation in the center has been clarified).} 
24.Rc1 
{Tartakower continues his plan of doubling his heavy pieces on the c-file.} 
Nb6 
{Instead of doubling the heavy pieces, Maroczy works his Knight closer to the without White position. The Knight attacks the c4-pawn a third time.} 
25.Be1 
{Tartakower retreats the Bishop and lets his Queen and Rook help defend the without c4-pawn.} 
h6 
{Maroczy prepares a new post for his e4-Knight on g5. Should White play Bh4 without (to cramp Black's position by controlling the d8-h4 diagonal), Black can without close off the diagonal with ...Ng5. } 
26.Bxe4 
{Tartakower figures that if he's going to grab the Knight, it had better be without done now. He trades his bad Bishop for Black's centralized Knight.} 
dxe4 
{Maroczy captures toward the sparsely-occupied Kingside (this also eliminates without the possibility of White's cxd5).} 
27.Qc3 
{Tartakower sets up a Queen & Bishop battery on the a5-e1 diagonal, increasing without his control of the dark squares. He plans to move the Queen to a5 and his without Rook to b1, attacking the Black Knight. } 
Nd7 
{The Black Knight gets out of the b7-Rook's way. Now the Rook controls the without b-file once again.} 
28.Rb1 
{The White Rook slides over and challenges Black's command of the open file.} 
Rxb1 
{By trading Rooks, Maroczy clears the b7-square for his Queen to occupy and without eases the congestion that was limiting his pieces' freedom of movement.} 
29.Nxb1 
{Tartakower completes the Rook swap.} 
Qb7 
{Maroczy's Queen occupies b7 (as we expected). Now the White Knight is in without peril. } 
30.Na3 
{Guarding the Knight on b1 would be foolish (it does no good sitting at the without rear), so Tartakower advances the Knight instead, getting it closer to the without action.} 
Qb6 
{The Black Queen inches ahead, taking the a5-square away from its White without counterpart.} 
31.Bd2 
{Tartakower anticipates 31...c5 32.dxc5 Qxc5, so he overprotects the e3-pawn without (so that his Queen will not become overworked trying to defend the c- and without e-pawns and the Knight.} 
Kf7 
{Here's that old theme again: centralize your King in the late middlegame and without endgame.} 
32.g3 
{Tartakower pushes the pawn in order to control more Kingside space (possibly without restricting the movements of the Black King should it try to advance).} 
Nf8 
{Maroczy's Knight heads for the Kingside (Nd7-g8-h7-g5-f3), but this seems without awfully slow.} 
33.Qb4 
{Tartakower, unhappy with the Black Queen's command of the b-file, offers to without trade the Queens off.} 
Qxb4 
{Maroczy takes him up on the offer.} 
34.Bxb4 
{In completing the trade of Queens, Tartakower increases the range of his bad without Bishop. } 
Nd7 
{Maroczy decides not to advance his Knight on the Kingside and brings it back without to the center instead. Next stop: b6, where it attacks the c4-pawn.} 
35.Ba5 
{Tartakower takes b6 away from the Black Knight. } 
g5 
{Maroczy begins a demonstration on the Kingside, advancing his pawn and without grabbing some space.} 
36.Kf2 
{Tartakower begins the centralization of his King.} 
Ke8 
{Maroczy's King is shut out of the center (since White controls d8, d6, & f6). without He brings his King toward the Queenside (if the White Bishop abandons the without a5-d8 diagonal, the Black King might reach the center via the Queenside).} 
37.Ke2 
{The White King keeps marching toward the center.} 
c5 
{Maroczy begins a breakthrough in the center. (38.dxc5 Nxc5 and the Knight without invades via b3; if White allows 38...cxd4 39.exd4, Black has a protected  without passed pawn.)} 
38.Nb5 
{Tartakower blocks the Bishop's attack on his c4-pawn and has two without possibilities of his own: Nc7, forking the King and Bishop, or Nd6, without protecting the c-pawn with check. } 
Kf7 
{By moving the King, Maroczy eliminates the threat of a Nc7 fork by White.} 
39.Kd2 
{The White King continues its interrupted travels (getting off of the without dangerous a6-f1 diagonal in the process).} 
cxd4 
{Maroczy begins his central breakthrough.} 
40.exd4 
{If Tartakower doesn't recapture, Black gets a passed pawn anyway (40...d3). without By recapturing, he keeps the material balance even.} 
f4 
{Maroczy begins his pawn onslaught. If 41.gxf4, the Black g- and h-pawns without (supported by the King) drive through to the eighth rank.} 
41.Nd6+ 
{The Knight forks the King and e4-pawn. However, if 42.Nxe4, then 42...fxg3 without 43.fxg3, and the Black King and two pawns steamroll down to the eighth without rank. } 
Kg6 
{Maroczy has to move his King to get out of check, so he places it where it without supports his Kingside pawns.} 
42.Kc3 
{The White King heads for the Queenside, where it might support the advance of without the c-pawn.} 
e3 
{Uh-oh. Maroczy advances one of his e-pawns. How will Tartakower respond?} 
43.Kd3 
{The White King scampers closer to the advancing pawn, unblocking the White without Bishop's access to the e1 promotion square at the same time. Now the c4-pawn without can't advance (it's pinned to the King!). } 
Nb8 
{The Black Knight maneuvers to better its position. Maroczy plans to have it without enter the fray via b8 and c6.} 
44.Ke4 
{The White King still watches the center (remember that the Bishop covers e1) without and unpins the c-pawn.} 
Nc6 
{The Black Knight lands on c6 and threatens White's Bishop. } 
45.Bc3 
{By pulling back to c3, the Bishop will help defend the e5-pawn if Tartakower without pushes the d-pawn.} 
e2 
{Maroczy inches the pawn toward promotion. Now the White Bishop is stuck on without the a5-e1 diagonal (if it leaves the diagonal, the pawn promotes).} 
46.gxf4 
{Tartakower begins the elimination of Black's threatened Kingside pawnstorm. without By capturing the f-pawn, he separates Black's Kingside pawns.} 
gxf4 
{Maroczy recaptures, keeping the material even. He hopes to prevent the without e2-pawn from becoming isolated by maintaining a pawn on the f-file.} 
47.Bd2 
{The Bishop hits at Black's f-pawn and discourages 47...Kg5 (because of the without pin on the Black King). } 
f3 
{The f-pawn is doomed, but Maroczy advances it for a reason...} 
48.Kxf3 
{...if the White King captures it...} 
Nxd4+ 
{...the Black Knight evens up the material, defends the e2-pawn, AND gives without check! } 
49.Ke3 
{It's not often that you get to see a King fork! Since the Knight can't be without defended, it must move away, leaving the e2-pawn at White's without mercy! } 
Nf5+ 
{The Knight checks... } 
50.Kxe2 
{...and the King escapes, killing the dangerous Black pawn at the same time.} 
Nxd6 
{Maroczy sees no way to promote one of his pawns (they're both blocked by without White pawns), so he decides to trade Knights to reduce White's offensive without chances.} 
51.exd6 
{After the recapture, Tartakower has connected passed pawns! Will he be able without to promote one?} 
Bxc4+ 
{Nope! The Bishop evens the material and gives check.} 
52.Ke3 
{The King escapes check and heads for the center.} 
Bb5 
{The Black Bishop heads the d6-pawn off at the pass. Now the pawn can't safely without advance. } 
53.Kd4 
{The White King runs to the aid of the d-pawn.} 
h5 
{Maroczy advances one of his pawns, hoping that his King and h-pawn duo can without break through to promote.} 
54.Kc5 
{The King valiantly attacks the Black Bishop...} 
Ba4 
{...which simply sidesteps, being careful to stay on the a4-e8 diagonal, where without it impedes the d-pawn's progress.} 
55.Kb6 
{The White King makes its way toward c7, where it will cover d7. Tartakower without wants to play d6-d7, and after ...Bxd7, Kxd7 he'll be ahead a Bishop for a without pawn.} 
Kf7 
{Unfortunately for Maroczy, he must abandon his plans to force his h-pawn without through. The King must come to the defense of d7 to prevent the loss of the without Black Bishop.} 
56.Kc7 
{The White King finally reaches c7, where it can cover the d-pawn's advance. without Again, Tartakower wants to play d6-d7 to trade the pawn for Black's Bishop.} 
Ke8 
{Maroczy gets his King to a square where it, too, covers d7. Now d6-d7 is without impossible, because the Black Bishop can capture it without fear of without retribution.} 
57.Bf4 
{By playing Bf4, Tartakower prevents the e6-pawn's advance. The players agree without that they're both stymied and call it a day. The game is drawn.}

1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 
{As we've come to expect, Tartakower plays in the hypermodern style, controlling the center from the flanks instead of occupying it with pawns.}

6.Qc2 
{Now a Knight exchange on c3 can be met by Qxc3 without doubling the pawns.}

{...which retreats to the corner (the absolute WORST square on the chessboard without for a Knight!).} 
19.e5 
{Another White pawn steps forward, driving into Black's half of the board. without This pawn attacks the Black Queen.} 
Qg6 
{Lasker offers to trade Queens. If 20.Qxg6, then Black can reply 20...fxg6, without half-opening the f-file for his Rooks. He needs to do SOMETHING to relieve without his cramped position!} 
20.Qe2 
{Reti knows that the best way to ease a cramped position is to trade pieces, without so he doesn't help Black out. The Queen sidesteps to avoid the swap.} 
Nc7 
{The Knight gets out of the corner, but it still doesn't have a lot of scope!} 
21.Ba3 
{Reti is using his army like a boa constrictor, squeezing Black tighter and without tighter. The Bishop commands the a3-f8 diagonal, taking all of these squares without away from Black.} 
Na6 
{The Knight was headed back to e8, but Lasker sees that this move is without impossible (because of White's reply Be7 and the d8-Rook is trapped and without lost!). The Knight has become a "flying Dutchman" -- wandering around the without board!} 
22.Rfe1 
{The Rook has little scope behind the f-pawn, but it can spring to life on the without e-file after the Queen moves.} 
Be8 
{Black is completely tied in knots! Lasker prepares to attempt to free without himself. If he pushes the f-pawn, the Bishop will finally have some play without along the e8-h5 diagonal.} 
23.Bd6 
{Reti cramps Black even further! It will now be impossible for Black to remove without the Bishop from the "hole" on d6 without sacrificing some material.} 
f5 
{Lasker is doing what he can to uncrowd his half of the board...} 
24.f4 
{...but Reti has no intentions of letting him squirm free. He locks up Black's without central pawns on the same color squares as the Black Bishop! (This is without possible because Reti's dark-square Bishop is developed OUTSIDE the pawn without chain!)} 
Qh6 
{Lasker sets up his next move -- ...Bh5, threatening the White Queen.} 
25.Bf3 
{But Reti blocks that threat and takes another square (h5) away from Black!} 
g5 
{Lasker is playing true kamikaze chess now (since he has little to lose!). He without attempts to open up the Kingside. It's risky to expose your King while without Queens are still on the board.} 
26.Ra2 
{Reti sees Lasker's intention -- open up the g-file and check the White King. without with a Black Rook. By advancing his own Rook, he covers the key g2-square without with another piece. Now he can safely block check with Qg2.} 
gxf4 
{Lasker proceeds to pry the g-file open.} 
27.gxf4 
{Reti completes the trade. Now the Kings face each other along an open file.} 
Rd7 
{Here come the reinforcements! The Rook is headed for g7, where it will check without White's King. Of course, the White Queen can't commit suicide by blocking without the check, and blocking with the Bishop results in a pin. What can White do?} 
28.Qe3 
{Now we see the reason for 26.Ra2! The Queen sidesteps and allows the Rook to without move to g2 to defend the King.} 
Rg7+ 
{Despite White's answer of 29.Rg2, Lasker checks the King anyway. He's giving without himself a little breathing room by getting pieces out from behind the pawn without chain and then trading them off.} 
29.Rg2 
{As expected, the Rook blocks the check...} 
Rxg2+ 
{...and Lasker trades the Rook off.} 
30.Kxg2 
{If 30.Bxg2, then ...Qg6 pins the Bishop. Better to recapture with the King without than to immobilize a piece.} 
Bh5 
{Another piece is offered up...} 
31.Bxh5 
{...and accepted.} 
Qxh5 
{White is still controlling a big chunk of territory on Black's half of the without board, but Black has some chance of getting his remaining pieces out from without behind the locked pawns.} 
32.Rg1 
{Reti threatens to move his King and discover check against the Black King.} 
Kf7 
{The King abandons the g-file before White can spring the discovered check.} 
33.Kh1 
{The White King bails out, too (because of 33...Rg8+).} 
Rg8 
{Lasker considers the position carefully and offers yet another trade...} 
34.Rxg8 
{...which Reti accepts.} 
Kxg8 
{This is an interesting position. White has a "bad" Bishop (developed OUTSIDE without the pawn chain, though) and Black has a badly misplaced Knight. Both Kings without are exposed, and with Queens still on the board anything can happen!} 
35.cxd5 
{The time is right to clear up the mess in the center. If Black replies without ...exd5, then White has a protected passed pawn on the e-file. If ...cxd5, without then White has opportunities on the Queenside.} 
cxd5 
{Lasker keeps the pawn structure symmetrical (which we know to be a good without idea!) and takes his chances, rather than allowing White a passed e-pawn.} 
36.b4 
{The b-pawn advances to a square where it's defended by the Bishop and can without protect the a5-pawn.} 
Kf7 
{Lasker is unsure of where the threats will come from, so he gets his King without closer to the board's center so that he can better deal with them from without either side (plus the threat of Qg3+ was still hanging in the air).} 
37.Qd3 
{The Queen moves to the d-file to prevent ...Qd1+ (with a chance of a draw by without perpetual check). It also supports the advance of the b-pawn (winning the without Knight). Look for multi-purpose moves like this in your own games.} 
Qh4 
{Lasker will now try to check on the e-file.} 
38.Qf1 
{No problem for Reti; he just covers the whole first rank and eliminates any without check possibilities there.} 
Qd8 
{Lasker has been making his own multi-purpose moves. His last move set up his without Queen's withdrawal to d8, where it covers the Black Knight's escape squares without (b8 and c7).} 
39.Qh3 
{Reti's Queen is threatening to pick off the h7-pawn.} 
Kg8 
{Lasker guards it the only way he can. If the Queen moves to guard the pawn, without 40.b5 wins the Black Knight for White.} 
40.Qg3+ 
{The Queen checks...} 
Kf7

41.Qg5 
{Reti offers to trade Queens. Will Lasker make the trade?} 
Qc8 
{Of course not! The Queen has to cover c7 and b8, or else the White b-pawn without will advance and win the Knight (which would have no retreat!).} 
42.b5 
{Can Reti win an endgame with just Queens and pawns on the board? HE thinks without so!} 
Qc1+ 
{SURPRISE! Instead of retreating his Knight (and trading it for the White without Bishop), Lasker checks the White King! He's trying for a draw by perpetual without check (not a bad idea, considering the circumstances).} 
43.Kg2 
{43.Qg1 Qxf4 won't do -- Black would be trading his Knight for a couple of without White pawns (and Black would have TWO passed pawns!). The King has to move without to escpae check.}

Qxh5+ 
{Lasker makes the trade.} 
49.Kxh5 
{Now study the board again; the Black Knight is attacked and has no safe without haven!} 
Kg7

50.bxa6 
{Reti has worked hard to win the Knight; now he claims his prize.} 
bxa6 
{Lasker recaptures. The position is worse than he thought: his a-pawns are without doubled AND immobile! The a7-pawn is stuck on a dark square and ripe for the without White Bishop's picking.}

Nf6 
{Capablanca (Black), unsure of Reti's intentions concerning the center, makes without a non-committal developing move and waits to see what Reti will do next.} 
2.c4 
{The c-pawn advances to the fourth rank, where it extends White's control to without d5. Now if Black plays d7-d5, White replies cxd5, exchanging a flank pawn without for a valuable center pawn.} 
g6 
{Capa sees that neither of his center pawns can advance two squares, so he without continues his development by preparing to fianchetto his Kingside Bishop.} 
3.b4 
{Reti needs to clear b2 for his Queenside Bishop, so the b-pawn must advance. without Why not advance it two squares? If Black attacks it by e7-e6, he's wasted a without tempo by advancing the g-pawn.}

{Capa fianchettos his Kingside Bishop. Once the f6-Knight moves, he'll control without the long a1-h8 diagonal and maybe even attack White's a1-Rook.} 
4.Bb2 
{Reti moves his own Bishop to the long a1-h8 diagonal, disputing Black's without control of it. He's also frozen the f6-Knight in place (if the Knight moves, without then Bxg7 wins Black's Bishop).} 
O-O

5.g3

b6 
{Capa does the same.} 
6.Bg2

1.Nf3 
{Reti begins in the usual hypermodern style, developing a piece instead of a without pawn. The Knight controls d4 and e5, preventing Black from playing without e7-e5. } 
c5 
{Maroczy chooses not to develop a center pawn, instead advancing a flank pawn. without The pawn on c5 prevents White from playing d2-d4, and allows the Black Queen without unrestricted access to the Queenside. } 
2.g3 
{In the hypermodern opening style, players choose to control the center with without flanked pieces. Reti proceeds in this vein, advancing the pawn to allow a without Kingside Bishop fianchetto (Bf1-g2). } 
Nc6 
{Maroczy advanced the c-pawn before playing this move so as not to block it without in. Now he's strengthened his control over the center (especially without d4). } 
3.Bg2 
{Reti continues to play the opening that's named after him. The Bishop exerts without control over e4 and d5. In hypermodern openings, the center isn't occupied without by pawns, but controlled by the influence of flanked pieces.} 
g6 
{Maroczy advances this pawn to enable him to later fianchetto his Bishop. BOTH without players are playing hypermodern chess!} 
4.c4 
{Reti advances this pawn for the same reason that Maroczy advanced his c-pawn: without he intends to play Nc3 without trapping his c-pawn behind the Knight. This without flank pawn advance also inhibits Black from playing d7-d5. } 
Bg7 
{As expected, Maroczy fianchettos the Kingside Bishop. This Bishop now without commands the long a1-h8 diagonal, and the potential threat to the b2-pawn without makes it hard for White to effectively develop his c1-Bishop (which must without guard the pawn). } 
5.Nc3 
{Reti develops his Knight and blocks the threat against the b2-pawn. It would without be unwise for Black to play ...Bxc3, giving up the very strong Bishop and without surrendering control of the long diagonal!} 
d6 
{Maroczy makes another preparatory pawn move: this time he opens up a diagonal without for the development of his light-square Bishop. }

( 9.Bxd4 
{NOT 9.Nxd4, because 9...cxd4 forks the White Knight and Bishop and forces without further trades on d4. Instead White begins with Bxd4, which is still bad for without White, because he gives up a Bishop for a Knight.} 
cxd4 
{The Black pawn merely recaptures. White can't play 10.Nxd4 Bxd4 (that just without loses material), so he's forced to move the threatened c3-Knight.} 
10.Ne4 
{The menaced Knight leaps out of danger. While it's true that Black now has without doubled d-pawns, they're not really weak since the g7-Bishop protects one of without them. The trade of Bishop for Knight wasn't worth it for White.}

10.Rab1 
{Reti removes his Rook from the long a1-h8 diagonal, getting it away from any without possible danger from the g7-Bishop. The Rook also defends the b2-pawn, without allowing the c3-Knight to move with out the loss of the b2-pawn.} 
Bc6 
{Maroczy's Bishop, protected by the b7-pawn, disputes White's control of the without other long diagonal (a8-h1). Little by little, the Hungarian is carving out without a spatial advantage for himself.}

b6 
{Maroczy advances the pawn to allow his c6-Bishop a retreat to b7 or a8; this without also allows him to keep the center closed after bxc5 bxc5.}

1.d4 
{Janowski open with his d-pawn, which generall leads to slower positional games; the central pawns aren't easily traded off, since the White Queen defends the d-pawn.} 
Nf6 
{Marshall's opening is a bit more circumspect. Instead of ...d5, which stops the White d-pawn cold but also commites Black to a strategy of occupying the center, he plays ...Nf6, which controls the center while keeping other options open.} 
2.Nf3 
{White piles up force on e5, making it difficult for Black to occupy key central squares.} 
d6 
{Marshall puts some influence of his own on e5, while also making it possible to develop the c8-Bishop.} 
3.h3 
{Janowski keeps the Black Bishop off of g4. But this is essentially a wasted move, as Black threatens nothing if his Bishop goes there.} 
g6 
{Marshall tips his hand. He'll fianchetto his Bishop to g7.} 
4.Bf4 
{Janowski keeps putting the pressure on e5, making sure that Black can't plant a pawn there.} 
Bg7 
{Marshall plays the anticipated fianchetto, influencing e5 indirectly.} 
5.Nbd2 
{By coming here the Knight doesn't interfere with the advance of the c-pawn. Janowski may have to prop up his d-pawn by playing c2-c3.} 
c5 
{Marshall challenges White in the center.} 
6.e3 
{Janowski could also have played c2-c3 first. As we'll see, it ultimately doesn't matter.} 
cxd4 
{Marshall trades (and half-opens the c-file).} 
7.exd4 
{Do you see the tactical reason why Nxd4 is impossible?} 
( 7.Nxd4 
{If White recaptures this way...} 
e5 
{...he gets forked by the Black e-pawn. } 
) 
6...Nc6 
{Marshall keeps up the pressure on the White center.} 
8.c3 
{As anticipated, the d-pawn needs to be propped up. Now you see why it didn't matter whether the c- or e-pawn advanced first -- either way, the same position arises.} 
O-O 
{This is a case where castling isn't performed to protect the King. Marshall wants to get his Rook toward the center.} 
9.Be2 
{White is merely continuing his development.} 
Re8 
{The reason for Black's decision to castle. The Rook now supports an e-pawn advance.} 
10.Nc4 
{Janowski begins to reorganize his pieces. The Knight is headed to e3, where is influences d5, f5, and g4.} 
Be6 
{The time is not yet right for the e-pawns advance, so Marshall gets his Bishop out to a square where it slashes across the center. The problem with this move is that it violates a basic chess principle: don't block an undeveloped center pawn with a piece.} 
11.O-O 
{Janowski gets a step closer to completeing his development.} 
Nd5 
{Attacking the f4-Bishop...} 
12.Bd2 
{...which retreats.} 
Rc8 
{This move was a major idea behind Marshall's trade of his c-pawn for White's d-pawn. Besides the fact that it's generally a good idea to trade one of your flank pawns for an opponent's central pawn, it also half-opened the c-file for Black's Rook.} 
13.Ng5 
{Janowski drives back the poorly-placed Black Bishop.} 
Bd7 
{The Bishop backs off.} 
14.Qb3 
{Janowski completes his development with a threat against the b-pawn. } 
h6 
{Marshall counters the threat on his pawn with a threat on a minor piece. The position is starting to heat up and get complicated. } 
15.Bf3 
{Yet another threat! The Bishop menaces the hanging Knight. With all this tension, something has to let loose! } 
hxg5 
{Marshall grabs the Knight...} 
16.Bxd5 
{...and Janowski returns in kind.} 
e6 
{Another threat -- this time against the Bishop.} 
17.Bf3 
{The Bishop backs off.} 
Qc7 
{The Queen defends the menaced pawn. Marshall's Kingside pawns are bit of a wreck, but he does hold a 2-1 pawn majority in the center. Meanwhile, he's lost a centrally-placed Knight for one that wasn't as well placed on the flank. On the other hand, his pieces are a bit better-placed (a battery on the c-file and two pieces bearing down on d4). } 
18.Ne3 
{The White Knight finally gets to e3. This quiet continuation is better than the fireworks that erupt after Bxg5 (see the variation).} 
( 18.Bxg5 Nxd4 19.cxd4 Qxc4 20.Qxb7 Rc7 21.b3 Rxb7 22.bxc4

) 
17...Na5 
{Marshall controls more Queenside space, so this is where he'll attack. He starts by driving off the White Queen.} 
19.Qd1 
{The Queen hits the bricks and goes the whole way back. Janowski might have played Qc2, but he preferred to have his Queen and Bishop on the same diagonal.} 
b5 
{Grabbing more space and preventing a2-a4.} 
20.Re1 
{The repositioning continues. The plan is for the Knight to go to g3, opening the e-file for the e1-Rook. } 
f5 
{Marshall intends to play ...Bf6, covering the hanging pawn on g5 while still controlling the long diagonal with the Bishop.} 
21.Nf1 
{Next stop: g3.} 
Bf6 
{The Bishop does double-duty: guarding the pawn while controlling the a1-h8 diagonal.} 
22.Ng3 
{Normally the Knight would be well-placed here (it could jump quickly to the center or participate in a Kingside attack). But Black's Kingside pawns are advancing and the Knight probably won't be able to stay here for long.} 
Nc4 
{The Knight leaps into the hole on c4 and forks the pawn and Bishop. } 
23.Bc1 
{The only move that saves all of the threatened material. } 
d5 
{Black is grabbing up space at a prodigious rate.} 
24.Nf1 
{Janowski's original plan (back at move 21) was probably to sacrifice the Knight for a pwn and blow open Black's Kingside. But Black's constant repositioning of his pieces have made that impossible, so Janowski gives up on the idea. However, 24.Ne2 was probably better.} 
Kg7 
{Clearing the back rank. The idea is for a Rook to shoot to h8 and start a flank attack. Marshall is using both sides of the board to attack!} 
25.Be2 
{Janowski want to trade his Bishop for the Knight that is cramping his Queenside...} 
Nd6 
{...but Marshall will have none of it.} 
26.Bd3 
{Again clearing the e-file for the Rook on e1.} 
Rh8 
{The anticipated attack has begun!} 
27.Re3 
{Janowski lifts the Rook to get it in front of his pawn chain.} 
Rh4 
{The Rook charges ahead, putting flank pressure on White's center.} 
28.Rg3 
{Janowski attempts to win a pawn... } 
Nf7 
{...but Marshall nips that in the bud. Now ...f4 is possible, harassing White's Rook. } 
29.Nh2 
{The idea is Nf3, driving off the annoying Black Rook. } 
e5 
{The pawn phalanx pushes forward, threatening to crush all in its path.} 
30.dxe5 
{Janowski has to take; otherwise ...e4 cramps him and will ultimately cost him the Exchange (...e4, followed by ...f4 and after White plays Rg4, Black responds ...Bxg4).} 
Bxe5 
{Marshall completes the pawn swap and now another Black piece enters the attack. } 
31.Nf1 
{Preparing to meet ...Bxg3 with ...Nxg3. } 
f4 
{Marshall shocks everyone with this move! Why not just win the Exchange immediately? See the variation.}

g4

{...followed by a Bishop...} 
Qxf4

35.g3 
{...and a crushing pawn fork! } 
Qh6 
{The Queen retreats to a square from which it can recapture.} 
36.gxh4 
{The Rook falls...} 
Qxh4 
{And the Queen beheads the offending pawn. But Black's attack continues. He's cleared away much of the wood around the White King. Now the Knight threatens to enter the brawl. } 
37.Be4 
{Janowski offers a Bishop to get some counterplay.} 
Rc4 
{Marshall rejects White's offer and instead brings his Rook into the fray.} 
( 36...dxe4 38.Qxd7 
{Pinning the Knight and preventing it from joining the attack, while attacking the Rook. } 
) 
38.Bxd5 
{Janowski snaps off the offered pawn...} 
Rf4 
{...and the Rook uses the cleared rank to slip to the Kingside. Now the f-pawn is menaced. } 
39.Qd2 
{The Queen steps up to cover the pawn. } 
gxh3 
{More wood flies off the table. Black still has an attack but it's running out of steam, and his own King is horribly exposed.} 
40.Re1 
{Janowski gets his Rook closer to the action.} 
Qg5+ 
{Marshall keeps the initiative by checking White.} 
41.Ng3 
{Janowski blocks the check with his Knight.} 
Ne5 
{Things get a bit complicated here. Marshall has several possibilities here. The first, more risky plan, is 42...Re4 43.Re3 Nf3+ 44.Rxf3 h2+ 45.Kh1 Qxd2. The second, more cautious plan, is 42...Nc4 43.Qd3 Nxb2, winning a pawn. Then there's the unclear ...Ng4, getting the Knight into the attack.} 
42.Re3 
{Janowski blocks the opposed Queens on the diagonal, preventing any ugly surprises that might occur after the Black Rook moves. But the immediate 42.Qe3 may have been better.} 
( 42.Qe3 Ng4 43.Qe7+ Kh6 44.Qxg5+ Kxg5 45.Re7 
{Black's attack has become less potent in the absence of the Queen.} 
) 
41...Qf6 
{And now, unfortunately for him, Marshall makes a mistake that lets White back into the game. His best bet was to continue the attack with h2+, a more forcing move than what he actually played. The attack on f2 is premature and should go nowhere.} 
( 41...h2+ 43.Kf1 Bh3+ 44.Ke2 Nc4 45.Bxc4 bxc4 ) 
43.Qe1 
{White's Queen does triple-duty: it still defends f2, while simultaneously keeping an eye on the promotion square h1 and backing up the Rook on the e-file.. } 
( 43.Ne4 
{This move, attacking the Queen and guarding the f2-pawn, is better. } 
) 
42...h2+ 
{Another step toward promotion. Also, by checking White, it's an initiative-grabbing move.} 
44.Kh1 
{Blocking the pawn's promotion, but also cornering the King. White would have done better to play 44.Kg2.} 
( 44.Kxh2 Ng4+ 
{Black wins the exchange. } 
) 
43...Ng4 
{Marshall keeps a nice grip on things despite his earlier misstep. The Knight adds to the attack on f2, while covering the h2-pawn. } 
45.Re7+ 
{Janowski hits Marshall with a nice tactic -- he forks the King and Bishop. } 
Kh6 
{The Bishop is lost, so Marshall moves his King into the fray. Moving the King back, away from the center, will hurt Black in the endgame (provided that the game lasts long enough!).}

Qh4 
{Black is threatening mate-in-one. Can you spot it?}

47...Rxf2+ 
{Marshall wastes no time in snapping up White's Queen.} 
49.Kxf2 
{Janowski recaptures. The position here is very unusual. White has three pieces for a Queen, but his passed pawn is a monster.} 
Qg4 
{A maneuvering move. Marshall wants to get his Queen to the last rank where it can harass the White King.} 
50.Rf7 
{Janowski sees the move ...Qd1 coming and doesn't want his Bishop to become pinned to the Rook, so he plays this preventive move.}

{Marshall checks again.} 
55.Kf2 
{And again Janowski retreats.} 
Qc2+ 
{It turns out that Marshall wasn't trying for a draw after all, but was merely playing for time while he thought of a new plan. He now sees that he can win a pawn by forking the King and b-pawn. } 
56.Kf3 
{Of course, the King must get out of check...} 
Qxb2 
{...allowing Marshall to snap off the pawn.} 
57.Rf4 
{Janowski's pieces are tied down. The King guards the buried Bishop, while both the Bishop and Knight watch over the promotion square. So Janowski gets his Rook closer to the action. 57.Ne4 would have saved the c-pawn and prevented the check. }

56...Qxc3+ 
{Marshall hangs onto the initiative by snaring another pawn with check.}

{Yet another fork by the Black Queen. } 
59.Be4 
{The Bishop saves itself, leaving the pawn to fend for itself.} 
Qd7+ 
{Marshall surprises everyone by not capturing the a-pawn. Instead he continues to harass the White King.} 
60.Kf3 
{Janowski is becoming visibly frustrated. He has a material superiority but has had no chance to use it due to Marshall's skillful play.} 
Kg5 
{Marshall's plan is really quite simple. He intends to suddenly turn the tables on White. The threat is ...Qh3, after which Black will promote the pawn. After Nxh1 Qxh1, Black will again have a material superiority. }

1.Nf3 Nf6 
{Both players have opened with good, though non-committal, moves. The Knights exert control over the center, but there's still some question as to whether the center pawns will advance. Neither player has tipped his hand.} 
2.d4 
{Dr. Lasker declares his intentions of occupying the center.} 
g6 
{Alekhine intends to control the center from a distance. The only reason for this pawn move is to allow the fianchetto of the Kingside Bishop. } 
3.Bf4 
{Lasker wants to support the d-pawn by playing e2-e3, but doesn't want to trap the Queenside Bishop behind the pawn chain. So the Bishop comes out first.} 
c5 
{Alekhine continues with the hypermodern strategy of striking at the center from the flanks. He offers to trade a flank pawn for a more valuable center pawn.} 
4.c3 b6 
{Alekhine's hypermodern strategy continues -- he's now planning to fianchetto both Bishops. } 
5.Nbd2 cxd4 6.cxd4 Bb7 7.e3 
{Lasker finally advances the e-pawn (an idea he'd planned back at his third move).} 
Bg7 
{Alekhine responds by completing his plan of fianchettoing both Bishops. The Bishops are strong, as they both sit on long diagonals. However, the b7-Bishop is the better of the two since its brother runs smack up against the d4-pawn.} 
8.Bd3 O-O 9.O-O 
{King safety is a must. Both Kings have retreated to the flanks.} 
Nc6 10.h3 
{I'm not sure why Lasker played this, as the Black Knight wasn't really threatening to come to g4. Controlling the open c-file by Rc1 would certainly have been more productive.} 
d6 11.Qe2 
{White's Rooks are connected; his development is complete. The Queen on e2 serves some useful functions. It backs up the Bishop on the a6-f1 diagonal, plus allows Qxf3 (instead of gxf3) in case Black decides to trade his b7-Bishop for the White Knight.} 
a6 
{Alekhine suspected that White wanted to force a trade of Bishops by playing Ba6 (eliminating the very well-posted b7-Bishop). Now that move is impossible as both the a8-Rook and b7-Bishop control a6. } 
( 10...) 
12.Rfd1 
{Lasker centralizes the Rook. Rfc1 would not be as good because it traps the a1-Rook behind the a- and b-pawns.} 
Qb8 
{It seems strange to place the Queen on the same diagonal as White's f4-Bishop, but the Queen isn't taking up a permanent post. It's headed for a7 where it can support Queenside operations.} 
13.Bh2 Qa7 14.a3 Rac8 15.Rac1 
{Both players jockey for control of the open c-file.} 
b5 16.b4 Nd7 
{Alekhine is switching his attention to the Queenside. It's not going to be easy for White to counter -- it's harder for him to switch his pieces to that side of the board.} 
17.Nb3 
{This move seems odd, but has a purpose. Lasker intends to play Rc2 followed by Rdc1 to double his Rooks on the open c-file. Getting the Knight out of the way allows the Queen to support the c2-Rook. } 
Nb6 { } 18.Rc2 Na4 19.Rdc1 Qa8 
{The Queen adds its support to the Knight. } 
20.h4 Na7 21.h5 
{Now this is interesting. Black seems to be stymied on the Queenside; since his pieces are concentrated on the a- through c-files, Lasker suddenly switches his attention to the Kingside.} 
Be4 22.Ne1 
{To make Nxd3 possible. Otherwise, after ...Bxd3 Qxd3, Black can play ...gxh5, ...Kh8, ...Rg8 and suddenly have a strong attack on the White King.} 
Bxd3 23.Nxd3 Rxc2 24.Rxc2 Rc8 25.hxg6 hxg6 
{White has managed to open the h-file but will have a tough time getting his heavy pieces over there to exploit it.} 
26.Na5 Nb6 
( 25...) 
27.Ne1 
{Now the Knight is backing up to overprotect the c2-Rook. This frees the Queen for other duties. } 
Qe4 
{The c2-Rook has suddenly become the center of attention. It's attacked twice and defended twice. } 
28.Bg3 
{Lasker makes a waiting move to see if Alekhine will reveal his plans.} 
Rxc2 
{Alekhine does just that, deciding to wipe the material off of the board.} 
29.Qxc2 Qxc2 30.Nxc2 Kf8

Nf6 
{Rather than commit himself to occupying the center with pawns (with 1...d5), without Janowski develops a Knight to a center-controlling square and adopts a "wait without and see" attitude.} 
2.Nf3 
{Lasker develops a Knight to a center-controlling post. From f3, the Knight without controls d4 and e5.} 
b6 
{By advancing the b-pawn, Janowski clears b7 for his light-square Bishop.} 
3.c4 
{Lasker increases his center control with this move. He now controls three of without the four central squares (e4 being the only one that he doesn't control).} 
Bb7 
{The Bishop moves to b7 to be able to command the long a8-h1 diagonal and to without bear down on White's Kingside. Janowski now has two pieces exercising without control over e4.} 
4.Nc3 
{Lasker strengthens his grip on d5 and begins to dispute Black's control over without e4.} 
d6 
{Janowski prevents White from playing Ne5. He also sets up an e7-e5 pawn push. without He can't push the pawn yet, though, because of 5...e5 6.dxe5 dxe5 7.Qxd8 without Kxd8 and Black loses his right to castle.} 
5.Bg5 
{Lasker tries to make the e-pawn push less attractive for Black. If Black now without advances the e-pawn, his f6-Knight will be pinned to his Queen.} 
Nbd7 
{Janowski makes the e-pawn push possible. Now it's safe to play 6...e5 7.dxe5 without dxe5 because the d7-Knight blocks the exchange of Queens.} 
6.Qc2 
{Lasker continues to position his pieces so that they control e4. If he can without put more control over this square than Black can, he'll be able to safely without play e2-e4.} 
e5

7.e3 
{If White plays dxe5, he loses the central pawn duo. With 7.e3, he protects without the d-pawn and holds the threat of e3-e4 in reserve for the future.} 
h6 
{Janowski could have played ...exd4, but opening up the game would be in without White's favor (since White has a lead in development). He "puts the without question" to the Bishop instead.} 
8.Bh4

26.Nf6 
{Lasker can't move the Rook away (26.Rf4 Re1+ 27.Qc1 Rxc1 28.Kxc1 gives Black without a winning advantage), so he moves the Knight to the Rook's defense. The without Knight does double-duty by attacking the e8-Rook at the same time.}

{The second White Rook slides over to defend the menaced Knight.} 
Kb8 
{The King pulls back on the general principle that it's usually a bad idea to without have the King and Queen on the same diagonal. Keeping them on the same without diagonal sometimes invites ugly pins that force unfavorable trades.} 
28.f3 
{The f-pawn advances to overprotect the e4-Rook. Now the White Queen or Knight without are free to perform other tasks.}

Qe8 
{The Queen backs up the threatened Rook.} 
33.Nf6 
{The Knight can safely come to f6 and attack the Black Queen (33...Bxf6 without 34.Rxf6 and Black can't play 34...Rxf6 because 35.Rxe8+ loses the Queen. without Also, the e6-Rook would be attacked three times and defended just twice).} 
Qc8 
{The Queen moves out of danger and still covers the e6-Rook.} 
34.Nh5 
{Lasker keeps control of the initiative by making another threat: this time, without it's against the g7-Bishop.} 
Bd4 
{If the Bishop retreats to f8, its own pawns on c5 and d6 block it in. The without Bishop stays active by moving to the outpost square d4.}

{Here's another threat from White: the Knight becomes the e6-Rook's third without attacker.} 
Re5 
{The menaced Rook advances and counterattacks the White Rook on f5.}

1.d4 
{Despite his arrogance, Alekhine is taking no chances. He remembers Janowski's without former reputation as a feared attacker, so he limits his risk by playing without 1.d4, which usually leads to quieter positional games.} 
Nf6 
{Will Janowski occupy the center with pawns, or control it from a distance without with pieces? Will he develop his Bishops through the center or fianchetto without them? Janowski keeps Alekhine guessing.} 
2.c4 
{Alekhine increases his center control. He now owns b5, c5, d5, and e5. Why without didn't he play 2.e4? Because this could transpose into an open game (as without though he'd played 1.e4), a route that Alekhine doesn't want to take.} 
d6 
{Janowski frees his light-square Bishop and sets up a future e7-e5 pawn push. without The pawn on d6 will support the e-pawn after the latter moves to e5.} 
3.Nc3 
{Alekhine quietly continues his development, making solid center-controlling without moves.} 
Bf5 
{Janowski's plan is clear: he's trying to prevent White from playing e2-e4 at without a future time. The Knight and Bishop both control e4, making it undesirable without for the pawn.} 
4.g3 
{Alekhine decides against developing his Bishop through the center. He'll without flank it instead and control the long a8-h1 diagonal.} 
c6 
{Janowski's position is already pretty cramped, so he does what he can. The without advance of the c-pawn gives him a way to develop his Queen and may support a without later advance of the d-pawn.} 
5.Bg2 
{Alekhine fianchettos his Bishop and controls the long diagonal. Notice that without the Black b7-c6 pawn pair provide an obstacle for the Bishop. This is without another reason for 4...c6.} 
Nbd7 
{The square a6 would be a terrible post for the Knight, so Janowski develops without it to the only other square possible. d7 has the advantage of being closer without to the center than a6. The disadvantage is that Black's position is more without cramped.} 
6.e4 
{Surprise! Now it's safe to push the e-pawn because the pawn is defended by without the White Knight and g2-Bishop.} 
Bg6 
{Move it or lose it! Now Janowski's position is REALLY cramped and Alekhine without has built up an awesome pawn center.} 
7.Nge2 
{The Knight can't go to f3 (it would block the g2-Bishop's defense of the without e-pawn), so it moves to e2 instead.} 
e5 
{The e-pawn advances, supported by the d7-Knight and d6-pawn. Janowski is without trying to get a little more elbow room.} 
8.h3 
{Alekhine wants to play Be3, but Black's reply of ...Ng4 would chase the without Bishop away. Alekhine takes g4 away from the Black Knight, making it safe without for his Bishop to occupy e3.} 
Qb6 
{Janowski annoys Alekhine. If White plays Be3, then Black now replies ...Qxb2, without costing White a pawn.} 
9.O-O 
{Alekhine grits his teeth. The Frenchman is really getting on his nerves! He without scans the board and quickly spots another good devloping move: castling. His without Kingside development is now complete.} 
O-O-O 
{Members of the crowd exchange delighted looks. Opposite-side castling! We're without really going to see a dogfight now!} 
10.d5 
{Alekhine doesn't like the look of the d8-Rook on the same file as his Queen. without He advances the d-pawn and challenges Black. Whether Black advances his without c-pawn or captures White's d-pawn with it, the d-file will be closed.} 
Nc5 
{Janowski does neither. Instead, he pops his Knight onto the protected square without c5.} 
11.Be3 
{Alekhine finally plays Be3 and pins the Knight to the Queen, risking the loss without of the b2-pawn.} 
cxd5 
{Janowski knows that if he captures the b2-pawn, White can simply harass his without Queen while continuing to improve his position. He instead opts to clarify without the pawn situation in the center.} 
12.cxd5 
{Alekhine closes the center and opens the c-file (which leads straight to the without Black King!).} 
Qa6 
{Janowski figures that he'd better unpin his Knight by getting his Queen off without of the a7-g1 diagonal before White tries something unpleasant (like Na4, for without instance).} 
13.f3 
{A two-edged move. Although he's blocked in his g2-Bishop, Alekhine has freed without his c3-Knight for action. The Knight is no longer tied to the defense of the without e4-pawn because the f-pawn now guards it.} 
Kb8 
{"Time to get my King off of the open c-file," Janowski says to himself (in without French, of course).} 
14.b4 
{Here's the moment the crowd's been waiting for: the White Queenside pawns without begin their forward advance. The idea is for the pawns to advance together without and sweep the Black defenders out of their way.} 
Ncd7 
{Consider the Knight swept. It retreats to the only available square.} 
15.a4 
{The second pawn steps forward.} 
Qc4 
{This is the ONLY move that the Queen has to get out of the way of White's without pawn-roller! Notice that the White a1-Rook, c3-Knight, e3-Bishop, and Queen without are all positioned to be able to attack on the Queenside.} 
16.Qd2 
{Alekhine sees that Black can capture the b-pawn. He's willing to give up the without pawn -- to launch an attack on Black's King! Besides, the pawn isn't really without lost (you'll see why in a minute).} 
Qxb4 
{The Black Queen takes the pawn...} 
17.Bxa7+ 
{...while the White Bishop grabs a Black pawn with check! The crowd is aghast! without Doesn't this lose the Bishop??} 
Ka8 
{NO!! Check out the variation to see why not!} 
( 16...Kxa7 
{There's no way that Black could take the Bishop (unless he wants to commit without chess suicide, that is!). Why?} 
18.Nb5+ 
{Because the White Knight checks and uncovers an attack on the Black Queen by without its White counterpart!} 
Kb8 
{The fact that the White Knight CHECKS is important because it forces Black's without reply. Black MUST get out of check...} 
19.Qxb4 
{...giving White time to capture the Queen! He's traded a Bishop for a Queen. without You or I would make a trade like that anytime!} 
) 
18.Rfb1 
{The a7-Bishop is still safe for the moment, because Black doesn't have time without to capture it. His Queen is attacked!} 
Qa5 
{The Black Queen uses the White pawn as a shield. Now the Black Queen attacks without the a7-Bishop.} 
19.Be3 
{Alekhine retreats his Bishop out of danger. Take a moment and look at all of without the White pieces that are bearing down on the Black King! There are two without Rooks and a Bishop, with the White Queen and light-square Bishop ready to without jump in.} 
Nc5 
{The White e3-Bishop bears down on the Black King's position, so Janowski without blocks its path with his Knight.} 
20.Rb5 
{The White Rook, protected by the c3-Knight and a-pawn, advances to harass the without Black Queen.} 
Qc7 
{Janowski must expend another tempo to save his Queen.} 
21.a5 
{The mighty pawn marches forward, covered by the a1-Rook.} 
Nfd7 
{Janowski continues to shift pieces over toward the threatened King's without position.} 
22.Nc1 
{Alekhine also begins shifting more troops over toward that side of the board.} 
Rc8 
{Janowski continues to strengthen his King's position. He sets up a battery on without the c-file (to give himself some counterplay after he moves the c5-Knight). without But his poor f8-Bishop and h8-Rook have no way to join the battle!} 
23.Nb3 
{The repositioning of the White forces continues. But can't Black play without 23.Nxb3?} 
Na6 
{Since both Black Bishops and a Rook are out of the action, Janowski decides without that its better to not trade pieces in this case. Instead, he withdraws the without Knight, unmasking his c-file battery. He threatens 24...Qxc3 25.Qxc3 Rxc3.} 
24.Na4 
{Since Black was threatenimg to win his Knight, Alekhine moves it out of without harm's way.} 
Be7 
{The Black dark-squared Bishop is very bad (as it's blocked in by its own without pawns), but Janowski figures that at least he can get it off of the back without rank and clear a path for his h8-Rook to join the fight.} 
25.Nb6+ 
{OUCH! Alekhine's Knight forks the Black King and Rook!} 
Kb8 
{The only ways to get out of a Knight check are to capture the Knight or move without the King. Black can't capture without losing material, and 25...Ka7 just without sets up a discovered check after 26.Nxc8. So Janowski makes the only other without move.} 
26.Rc1 
{Alekhine relentlessly continues the attack! Now both the Black Queen and without c8-Rook are under fire.} 
Ndc5 
{Janowski can't possibly save both pieces, so he shields the most valuable one without by blocking the attack.} 
27.Nxc5 
{Alekhine begins to break up the Black position. He starts the demolition without process by swapping Knights.} 
dxc5 
{Janowski must recapture or be behind in the material count.} 
28.Nxc8 
{Finally! The threat of this move hung over Black's head for the longest time! without Alekhine used this continued threat to keep Janowski off-balance.} 
Rxc8 
{There were a number of ways to capture the Knight, but this one is the most without sensible. The former h8-Rook finally gets into the game. Now what will White without do to continue the attack?} 
29.Bf1 
{Alekhine squints at the board for a long time before deciding on the Bishop without move. With this move, he defends the b5-Rook and sets up a threat against without the a6-Knight.} 
Qd7 
{Janowski tries to tie the White Bishop to the f1-h3 diagonal by attacking the without White h-pawn. Now, if the Bishop moves off the diagonal, ...Qxh3 grabs a without pawn.} 
30.Rb6 
{Alekhine is unafraid. He knows that 31.Bxa7 will win the Knight (Black can't without reply bxa6, because the b-pawn is pinned!). A pawn for a Knight? Alekhine without will take that trade any day!} 
c4 
{Janowski bails frantically. The pawn advances to block the f1-Bishop's attack without on the Black Knight.} 
31.Rxc4 
{The White Rook swats the annoying pawn.} 
Rxc4 
{Janowski, with his King under fire, decides that trading pieces is his only without hope. If he can get enough of the attacking pieces off of the board, he may without still have a chance...} 
32.Bxc4 
{The White Bishop recaptures and again attacks the Knight. Why doesn't Black without just move the Knight away? Because that would allow the a-pawn to advance without and attack the b-pawn (the Black King's last defending pawn).} 
Qxh3 
{Janowski gives his Knight up for dead and extracts some slight compensation without by capturing the White h-pawn.} 
33.Qg2 
{WHAT?!? Why doesn't Alekhine just play 33.Bxa7? We'll have to ask him about without this later.} 
Qxg2+ 
{Janowski figures that removing the Queens from the board cuts down on White's without attacing chances.} 
34.Kxg2 
{Alekhine plays the only move that gets him out of check.} 
Bd8 
{Janowski counterattacks! Now, if White plays 35.Bxa7, Black counters with without 35...Bxb6.} 
35.Rb2 
{Alekhine retreats the Rook, while maintaining the pin on the b7-pawn.} 
Kc8 
{By shuffling the King to the side, Janowski dissolves the pin on the pawn.} 
36.Bxa6 
{Alekhine begins the process of trading down to a winning endgame.} 
bxa6 
{Forced (otherwise Black falls even farther behind in the material count).} 
37.Bb6 
{Alekhine continues to offer trades (which will be to his advantage. With an without equal number of pawns on the board, his Rook would be superior to Black's without Bishop in the endgame).} 
Bg5 
{Janowski declines the trade. He instead hopes to sneak his dark-square Bishop without in behind the White pawn chain to prevent them from advancing to dark without squares.} 
38.Rc2+ 
{Alekhine checks along the open c-file and plans to advance his Rook to the without seventh rank to invade the Black position.} 
Kb7 
{The King advances, both to protect his a-pawn and to try to prevent the White without Rook from penetrating into the Black position.} 
39.d6 
{Alekhine sees a way to win one of Black's Bishops and lock in the win...} 
f5 
{By advancing the pawn, Janowski allows his light-square Bishop to get into without play along the e8-h5 diagonal. Even so, Black's game is pretty much a lost without cause.} 
40.d7 
{The pawn marches forward. Since the White dark-squared Bishop controls the without promotion square d8, Alekhine can play 41.d8(Q) Bxd8 42.Bxd8, winning one of without Black's Bishops. Janowski sees that it's hopeless and throws in the towel.}

1.d4 
{Capablanca (White) opens with a d-pawn advance, which will probably lead to a without positional (rather than tactical) game.} 
f5 
{Tartakower (Black) finally settles down and replies with the Dutch Defense. without Remember that White's ideal setup is a pawn duo on d4 and e4. The Black pawn without on f5 makes this setup impossible.} 
2.Nf3 
{Capa develops a Knight and increases his control of the center.} 
e6 
{Tartakower props up his f-pawn and releases his Queen and dark-square Bishop.} 
3.c4 
{Capa advances the c-pawn so as to not block it in with his Knight on c3.} 
Nf6 
{Tartakower develops a Knight toward the center...} 
4.Bg5 
{...and Capa pins it! He's also developed a second minor piece.} 
Be7 
{Tartakower blocks the pin on his f6-Knight and develops a piece at the same without time.} 
5.Nc3 
{Capa gets his other Knight out. You can see that if he'd played this move without before he advanced the c-pawn that the pawn would now be blocked in.} 
O-O 
{Tartakower completes his Kingside development by castling.} 
6.e3 
{By advancing the pawn AFTER developing the dark-square Bishop, Capa prevented without the Bishop from being blocked in. The move order a player chooses in the without opening is often very important.} 
b6 
{It will be impossible to develop the light-square Bishop through the center without because of the line of pawns on d7-f5, so Tartakower prepares to fianchetto without it.} 
7.Bd3 
{Capablanca gets his Bishop off of the back rank and prepares to castle.} 
Bb7 
{Tartakower fianchettos his Bishop. Now it commands the long a8-h1 diagonal.} 
8.O-O 
{Capa's Kingside development is now complete. All he has to do now to totally without finish his development is to move his Queen off of the back rank to connect without his Rooks.} 
Qe8 
{Tartakower is thinking of developing his Queen to h5 for a Kingside attack without (...Qh5, ...Ng4, etc.). } 
9.Qe2 
{Capablanca connects his Rooks and finishes up his development.} 
Ne4 
{Tartakower saw definite possibilities for a White e-pawn advance to e5, so he without blocks the pawn with a centrally-posted Knight. He also uncovers a double without attack on the White g5-Bishop (from the Black e7-Bishop and e4-Knight).} 
10.Bxe7 
{Capa decides to trade his Bishop for Black's. He anticipates the immediate without reply of ...Qxe7.} 
Nxc3 
{Good thing Capa wasn't holding his breath! Instead of ...Qxe7, Tartakower without snaps up the White Knight and attacks the White Queen.} 
11.bxc3 
{Capa is forced to capture the Knight and double his pawns on the c-file. But without these pawns aren't really weak, as each one contributes in some way to without White's control of the center.} 
Qxe7 
{Tartakower evens the material by grabbing the White Bishop.} 
12.a4 
{Capablanca grabs more Queenside space. He's preparing to bring both Rooks to without the Queenside and launch an assault there.} 
Bxf3 
{Tartakower misjudges the position. He sees that it's likely to remain closed, without so he feels that his Knight will be better in the long run than White's without Bishop. But he gives up his wonderfully-placed Bishop to take away the without Knight.} 
13.Qxf3 
{The Queen recaptures and attacks the a8-Rook.} 
Nc6 
{By moving the Knight, Tartakower not only blocks the Queen's attack but also without allows the two Rooks to defend each other. The Rooks are connected, and without Black's development is finally complete.} 
14.Rfb1 
{Capa prepares a Queenside attack by bringing his Kingside Rook over to the without half-open b-file.} 
Rae8 
{The best way to meet a flank assault is to counterattack in the center. without Tartakower means to do just that. He prepares by bringing his Queenside Rook without to the e-file to support an advance of the e-pawn.} 
15.Qh3 
{Capablanca wants to play f2-f4, guarding e5 and preventing the Black e-pawn without from occupying it. He moves his Queen to make his own f-pawn advance without possible.} 
Rf6 
{The Rook advances and may be shifted to the h-file to attack the White Queen.} 
16.f4 
{Capa is unconcerned. He advances the f-pawn as planned. Now if Black plays without ...Rh6, the Queen can simply return to f3.} 
Na5 
{Tartakower prevents a minority attack by the White a-pawn, an attack that without would lead either to a Black Queenside pawn weakness or the opening of the without a-file for White's Rooks.} 
17.Qf3 
{The White Queen has no future on the h-file, so it returns to f3. The Queen without may later head for the Queenside via the light squares on the d1-h5 and without a4-d1 diagonals.} 
d6 
{Black won't easily give up the idea of an e6-e5 pawn push. The d-pawn adds without its voice to the argument over who owns e5.} 
18.Re1 
{Capa conceives his own plans for a White e-pawn push! The e1-Rook backs up without the pawn.} 
Qd7 
{Tartakower finally gives up on trying to advance his e-pawn. He removes his without Queen from the dangerous e-file and the possibility of attack by the White without e1-Rook.} 
19.e4 
{The  White e-pawn advances. Now Capablanca threatens to open the e-file.} 
fxe4 
{Tartakower captures the e-pawn...} 
20.Qxe4 
{...and has his pawn captured in return. Now Capa threatens to win another without pawn (21.Qxh7+).} 
g6 
{Tartakower blocks the threat, but his Kingside is now very weak. } 
21.g3 
{Capa has no problems advancing his Kingside pawns due to the closed nature of without the position (Black has little maneuvering room, so there is little chance without of a surprise attack).} 
Kf8 
{The Black King moves closer to the e8-Rook, to help in its defense should the without e-file be completely opened.} 
22.Kg2 
{The White King steps forward to support the White Kingside pawn advance.} 
Rf7 
{Tartakower starts to put the wagons in a circle. He sees that a White attack without is coming, and he doesn't want to leave any pieces hanging.} 
23.h4 
{The White Kingside pawnstorm continues unabated.} 
d5 
{Tartakower sees a chance to divert White's attack before it has a chance to without strengthen. The d-pawn advances and forks the White Queen and c-pawn.} 
24.cxd5 
{Capa must either take the pawn or retreat the Queen. Retreating the Queen without allows 24...dxc4 and the White Bishop must give ground too. Capa decides without that swapping pawns is the lesser of the evils.} 
exd5 
{Now both the Black d-pawn and e8-Rook attack the White Queen. Retreating the without Queen leads to a sequence that gives Black command of the e-file, so...}

Qxe8 
{The only move; otherwise, Black is a Rook behind for nothing.} 
26.Rxe8+ 
{Taking the Queen checks the King...} 
Kxe8 
{...and leads to material equality. Actually, since the position is semi-open, without White's Bishop is a little stronger than Black's Knight, giving White a without slight edge.} 
27.h5 
{Capa's plan is to open up the h-file, then use it as an avenue of invasion without for his Rook.} 
Rf6 
{Tartakower seeks to discourage hxg6, but White is unconcerned...} 
28.hxg6

29.Rh1 
{The Rook slips over to the h-file. All is going according to White's plan.} 
Kf8 
{Tartakower again circles the wagons. The King moves closer to the Rook and without pawn to aid in the defense.} 
30.Rh7 
{An open file is only valuable if it yields a penetration point by which a without friendly Rook can infiltrate the enemy position. The White Rook moves to the without penetration point on h7. The invasion has begun!} 
Rc6 
{30...Rf7 31.Rxf7 Kxf7 only helps White because of his strong Bishop. The without Black Rook must move to the Queenside to defend the menaced c-pawn.} 
31.g4 
{Capablanca means to exploit his 2-1 Kingside pawn majority. The White without Kingside pawns advance ominously.}

gxf5 
{...but at the cost of allowing White a passed g-pawn in return.} 
35.Kg3

{The White King ducks under cover.} 
Rf3

38.Kg5 
{The White King advances in support of the g-pawn and attacks the Black Rook without at the same time.} 
Re4 
{The Black Rook can't check by ...Rg4 (or else the f-pawn falls), so the Rook without returns to the open e-file.} 
39.Kf6 
{The White King gets as close to the Black King as it can in order to force without the pawn through to the eighth rank.} 
Kg8

{Capa checks the Black King, hoping to drive it into the corner.} 
Kh8 
{Tartakower complies with White's wishes.}

42.Kxf5 
{Capa just grabs another pawn. Now the material is even again.} 
Re4 
{Since the White King is no longer on c6, Rc8+ is no longer a mate threat. The without Rook is now free to move to e4 and menace White's d-pawn.} 
43.Kf6 
{Now the Rc8+ mate threat is on again!} 
Rf4+ 
{Rather than passively retreat to e8, Tartakower aggressively checks White, without giving him no time to play the winning Rook move.} 
44.Ke5 
{Capa defends the attacked pawn, gets out of check, and attacks the Rook and without Black d-pawn all at one shot!} 
Rg4 
{Tartakower turns his aggressions toward the passed g-pawn.}

48.Kd6 
{The White King creeps forward and opens up space for the d-pawn's advance.}

{The White a-pawn falls...}

1.d4 
{Marshall (White) opens with his d-pawn. Games that begin with d2-d4 usually without lead to closed positions. That's because the advanced d-pawn is without automatically protected by the Queen, which makes it harder for Black to without capture it. } 
e6 
{Tartakower (Black) plays cautiously and disguises his intentions. Will he without play 2...d4, 2...Nf6, 2...Nc6, or something else altogether? Marshall must without proceed without any real idea of what his opponent's plans are.} 
2.c4 
{This move is common for White in the d-pawn openings. The idea is to advance without the c-pawn before playing Nb1-c3 (which would block the pawn's advance). without With the pawn on c4, White increases his control over the center.} 
f5 
{Tartakower's intentions are now clear. This is the Dutch Defense, in which without Black hopes to set up an outpost on e4 and launch an attack on the without Kingside. } 
3.Nc3 
{Marshall continues with the usual d-pawn opening set-up. Notice how his pawns without control b5-e5 and his Knight disputes Black's control over without e4. } 
Nf6 
{Tartakower continues his development. This move is in keeping with the idea without of establishing an outpost on e4. } 
4.Bg5 
{Marshall develops another piece, pinning the Black f6-Knight to the Queen. without The other reason he made this move was to allow him to make the pawn push without e2-e3 without trapping the dark-square Bishop behind his pawn chain. } 
Be7 
{Tartakower breaks the pin and completes his Kingside development. Now the without f6-Knight is free to move and uncover an attack from the e7-Bishop on without White's Bishop on g5.} 
5.e3 
{Marshall's e-pawn advances and allows his light-square Bishop and Queen to without develop. This move also props up the d4-pawn. Notice that Marshall waited without until his dark-squared Bishop was developed before he pushed the e-pawn.}

{Black castles early to get his King off of the dangerous center files and without develop his Rook. After the f6-Knight moves, it may also be possible for the without Black f-pawn to safely attack White's Kingside under the Rook's protection.} 
6.Bd3 
{Marshall continues to develop his pieces before undertaking any offensive without operations. The Bishop exerts its influence over e4 and helps prevent the without Black Knight from advancing there.} 
b6 
{Tartakower sees that the pawns on the c8-h3 diagonal have hopelessly blocked without his c8-Bishop from developing through the center, so he advances the b-pawn without to allow him to fianchetto his Bishop instead. } 
7.Nf3 
{Marshall develops his last minor piece. The Knight defends the g5-Bishop, without controls the square e5, and clears the way for castling. It also blocks the without easy win of a pawn by the soon-to-be fianchettoed Black Bishop (...Bb7xg2).} 
Bb7 
{As anticipated, Tartakower fianchettos his light-square Bishop. This piece is without extremely well-placed, controlling the long a8-h1 diagonal and bearing down without on White's Kingside. } 
8.O-O 
{Although it's pretty obvious that Black's attack will come on the Kingside, without Marshall fearlessly castles "into" the attack.} 
Ne4 
{Since e4 is attacked twice by White and defended twice by Black, Tartakower without feels that it's now safe to occupy this square. But Reti leans over to us without and whispers, "That costs him a pawn!" We'll see...} 
9.Bxe7 
{Marshall, like a shark, smells blood. He sees what Reti and others in the without crowd saw, and begins his campaign to win a pawn. He starts by grabbing the without Black e7-Bishop and threatening the Black Queen.} 
Qxe7 
{Tartakower makes the obvious recapture. But could he have ignored the threat without and played 9...Nxc3, setting up his own threat on White's Queen? See the without variation to find out.} 
( 8...Nxc3 
{Let's look at a possible variation to Black's ninth move. Here Black grabs without the c3-Knight. The material is still even. (Variation by Alekhine).} 
10.Bxd8 
{White chooses to capture the Black Queen. He could also have played bxc3, but without that leaves him with a buried d3-Bishop and an ugly Queenside pawn without structure.} 
Nxd1 
{Of course, Black must take the White Queen to keep the material even.} 
11.Bxc7 
{White replies by clipping the c7-pawn.} 
Nxb2 
{The Black Knight responds in kind by snatching the b2-pawn.} 
12.Be2 
{Now White sets about trapping the Black Knight. Black will be hard-pressed to without get his Knight to safety (and odds are that the Knight won't make it). So without Black is better off playing the actual game move and only losing a pawn.} 
) 
10.Bxe4 
{Marshall gives up a Bishop for a Knight, but only temporarily. See the without variation for the reason why he captures with the Bishop instead of the without c3-Knight.} 
( 10.Nxe4 
{If White were to capture with the Knight instead of the Bishop...} 
fxe4 
{...he'd get nailed with an ugly pawn fork that loses a piece to without Black! } 
) 
9...fxe4 
{Tartakower must recapture or remain behind by a piece. He recaptures with the without pawn in order to preserve his powerful Bishop on the long diagonal. The pawn without also threatens the White f3-Knight.} 
11.Nd2 
{Of course the Knight must move, so why not go to a square where it attacks without the Black pawn on e4?} 
Qh4 
{Tartakower is laboring under the misconception that this Queen move saves the without e4-pawn. See the variation to his next move (Black's move 12) to find out without why it doesn't.} 
12.Ncxe4 
{Marshall sees that he can safely take the pawn. However, we're still without scratching our heads. Then the answer comes to us...} 
Nc6 
{Tartakower advances his Knight. His Rooks are now connected and protect each without other. For the reason why the Bishop can't just capture on e4, see the without variation.} 
( 11...Bxe4 
{Here's what might have happened had the Bishop captured on e4...} 
13.g3 
{White lashes out at the Black Queen.} 
Qf6 
{The Queen is forced to retreat...} 
14.Nxe4 
{...and now the Bishop is easy pickings for the Knight. Black finds himself without behind by a pawn.} 
) 
13.f4 
{Marshall advances his f-pawn to allow his f1-Rook to join in the fun.  } 
Ne7 
{Tartakower begins to reposition his Knight. The Knight is heading for f5, without from which White will be hard-pressed to remove it (g2-g4 would leave the without White King dangerously exposed). } 
14.Rf3 
{Marshall boldly pushes his Rook forward, in preparation for a Kingside without attack.} 
Nf5 
{As expected, Tartakower's Knight comes to f5 and prevents the White Rook from without occupying g3. } 
15.Rh3 
{Marshall attacks the Black Queen in order to drive it away from the Kingside.} 
Qe7 
{The Black Queen withdraws to one of just two squares available to it.} 
16.Qh5 
{White's Queen comes crashing into the fight. Now Marshall threatens Qh5xh7+, without winning a pawn and breaking up Black's Kingside pawn structure.} 
g6 
{The advance of the Black g-pawn threatens White's Queen and allows the Black without Queen to guard the h7-pawn. } 
17.Qe2 
{Marshall's attack has lost its sting, so the Queen bails out. Because without Marshall intends to play Ne4-g5, the Queen occupies d2 to keep f3 clear as a without possible later retreat square for the Knight. } 
Rf7 
{Tartakower advances his f-Rook, clearing a space for his other Rook to occupy without f8 and aid in the defense of the Kingside.} 
18.Ng5 
{Marshall's Knight leaps forward and attacks the Black f7-Knight. But White without had more constructive moves. See the variation lines.} 
( 18.Nc3 
{In these variations by Alekhine, we'll see that White could have successfully without shifted his attack from the Kingside to the center. He would begin by moving without his Knight to c3 to support the advance of the e-pawn.} 
g5 
{In one of Black's two choices, he decides to advance the g-pawn. He hopes to without trade it off and open up lines for counterattack against White's King.} 
( 17...Qb4 
{In the second of Black's two choices, his Queen shifts to the Queenside to without assault White's b-pawn.} 
19.Rb1 
{White simply defends the pawn, and after a2-a3, Nd2-f3, and e3-e4, sets up a without position similar to the one in the other variation.} 
) 19.fxg5 
{White obliges him by indeed trading off the pawns.} 
Qxg5 
{Black regains his pawn (although he's still a pawn down). Now his Queen and without Rook lurk ominously on the Kingside.} 
20.Nf3 
{The White Knight comes to the rescue, driving the Black Queen back once without again. (Too bad Black has a Knight on f5, guarding g3, or else White could without set up a truly hideous pin with Rh3-g3!).} 
Qe7 
{The Black Queen is forced back by the advance of White's Knight.} 
21.e4 
{Now White begins action in the center by advancing his e-pawn. After the without Black Knight retreats, Black's position will be cramped and White can use without his space advantage to attack either in the center or on the Kingside.} 
) 
17...Rg7 
{The Black Rook simply sidesteps the White Knight's attack. Now, since without Marshall's attack has fizzled, the posting of the Knight on g5 seems kind of without pointless, aside from the slight cramping effect on Black's game.} 
19.Ngf3 
{Marshall, seeing that the Knight isn't accomplishing much on g5, pulls it without back to f3 where it can defend the d4-pawn, allowing the e3-pawn to advance.} 
Qb4 
{Tartakower shifts his attention to the Queenside. The Black Queen menaces the without b2-pawn.} 
20.Rb1 
{The White b-pawn must be defended, so Marshall decides to protect it with his without a-Rook.} 
c5 
{Tartakower decides that it's time for his a8-Rook to join the fight. He without advances his c-pawn in order to open up a file for the Rook. Now either the without c- or d-file is guaranteed to become half-open.} 
21.Qd3 
{Marshall doesn't want to reply to ...c5xd4 with e3xd4 (he wants to save the without e-pawn for a future e3-e4), so he moves the Queen to d3 in order to defend without the d-pawn a second time.} 
cxd4 
{Tartakower swaps the pawn off, half-opening the c-file for his Rook.} 
22.Nxd4 
{Marshall doesn't want to play 22.exd4 (for reasons already mentioned) and without 22.Qxd4 is obviously bad (22...Nxd4!), so he's left with the capture by the without Knight.} 
Rc8 
{Tartakower siezes the half-open c-file with his Rook. This has the additional without effect of tying the White d2-Knight to the defense of the c4-pawn (if the without Knight moves away, then ...Qxc4, Qxc4 Rxc4 wins back Black's pawn).} 
23.e4 
{Marshall, tired of seeing his space and mobility being whittled away, finally without pushes the e-pawn and digs at the Black Knight.} 
Nxd4 
{Tartakower responds by trading his Knight for White's.} 
24.Qxd4 
{This was Marshall's only move (otherwise he would lose a piece).} 
d5 
{Tartakower offers to sacrifice another pawn. True, he'll be behind by two without pawns, but Marshall will be stuck with a weak isolated d-pawn. He'll have to without tie up a piece to defend it, which more than offsets Black's two lost pawns.} 
25.a3 
{In order to trade off pawns on d5, Marshall must kick the Black Queen off of without b4 (to allow White to play c4xd5 without having to worry about Qb4xd4).} 
Qf8 
{The Black Queen slips back to f8, a square from which it can attack White's without f4-pawn.} 
26.exd5 
{Marshall begins the pawn slaughter on d5, and at the same time allows his without Queen to protect the f4-pawn from Black's Queen.} 
exd5 
{Tartakower continues with his plan of a pawn sacrifice designed to leave without White with a weak d5-pawn.} 
27.cxd5 
{Marshall completes the pawn trade. Now his d5-pawn is isolated (without c- or without e-pawns to protect it) and is consequently very weak. It will require the without constant protection of a piece to prevent its capture. } 
Rd8 
{Tartakower doubles up on the weak pawn, attacking it twice (with Bishop and without d-Rook).} 
28.Ne4 
{At first glance, this seems to give up the d5-pawn. But this move actually without prevents Black from capturing it! For the reason why, see the variation to without Black's next move.} 
Rf7 
{Black stops White's planned Ne4-f6 cold (see variation). Now what will without Marshall do about his threatened pawn?} 
( 27...Bxd5 
{If Black had tried to win the d5-pawn...} 
29.Nf6+ 
{...White would simply have forked the Bishop and King.} 
Kh8 
{The Black King, in check from the Knight, must move (...Kg8-f7 is possible, without but unwise).} 
30.Nxd5 
{Now the Knight can grab the Black Bishop, leaving Black a piece behind. It's without true that the Knight is pinned, but White has plenty of ways to move the without Queen while still defending the Knight, so the pin isn't critical.} 
) 
29.d6 
{Seeing that the pawn is lost, Marshall advances it. He hopes that the game without will run 29...Bxe4 30.Qxe4 Rxd6, where White will still be a pawn ahead without while fewer pieces on the board will be to White's advantage.} 
Rxf4 
{But Tartakower will have none of that! Instead, he grabs the White f-pawn and without pins the White Knight to the Queen.} 
30.Qc4+ 
{Marshall's Queen slides over and gives check. If Tartakower plays 30...Rf7, without then 31.Re3 or Re1 holds the fort, while the White Queen keeps a pin on the without Black f7-Rook.} 
Qf7 
{Tartakower blocks the check on his King and forces the exchange of Queens. without Once the White d6-pawn falls (a few moves from now), the material will once without again be even.} 
31.Qxf7+ 
{Marshall is forced to exchange Queens, or else he'll lose his Knight with no without compensation.} 
Rxf7 
{Tartakower completes the exchange of Queens. Now the White pieces are without scattered and disorganized. What will Marshall do?} 
32.Re3 
{Marshall moves the Rook to protect the piece (the Knight) which protects his without pawn. In theory, this is a good idea. In practice, however, ...} 
Bxe4 
{...it doesn't work (not this time, anyway). Tartakower makes use of a tactic without called "removing the guard". He removes the piece guarding the d6-pawn in without order to safely capture the pawn on his next move.} 
33.Rxe4 
{Marshall has to capture the Black Bishop or else he'll find himself a piece without behind.} 
Rxd6 
{With the protecting Knight removed, Tartakower can now safely capture the without d6-pawn. The material is now dead even.} 
34.Re2 
{Marshall prepares 35.Rf1 Rxf1 36.Kxf1, clearing off a pair of Rooks and without making it safer for his King to advance toward the center. Centralizing the without King is a common endgame theme.} 
Rd3 
{Tartakower get his Rook ready to harass White's Queenside pawns. After a without future ...Rb3, one of White's Rooks must stay tied to the b-file or second without rank to protect the White b-pawn. Then Black's pawns can advance unmolested.} 
35.Rf1 
{Marshall prepares the f-file Rook swap.} 
Kg7 
{Tartakower decides not to exchange Rooks. Instead, he gets the jump on White without in King centralization. Now, after 36.Rxf7 Kxf7, the Black King will be without closer to the center than White's will.} 
36.Rc2 
{Marshall gets a jump of his own. If Tartakower decides to start the Rook without trade on f1 (...Rxf1,Kxf1), the c2-Rook will be able to advance to c7 and without start attacking Black's Queenside pawns. See the variations to Black's next without move.} 
Rfd7 
{Rather than make the trade (see variations), Tartakower doubles his Rooks on without the d-file, threatening to swap off Rooks (with check!) on d1.}

{Black could try to check White's King, but this leads nowhere...} 
38.Kf2 
{Now that the White King has moved, the Black Rook can't attack the White without h-pawn successfully (38...Rh1 39.h3). In fact, all Black has done is drive without the White King toward the center (where the King wants to be anyway!).}

{White has his choice of a7 or h7 pawns. Now, if Black tries to even it up by without ...Rxb2, White grabs the h7 pawn. If Black tries h7-h6, White plays Ra7-a6, without preventing the pawn's advance (because of discovered check!).}

37.h3 
{Anticipating the Rook trades on d1, Marshall advances his h-pawn to give his without King an "escape hatch" on h2. Here the players decide to call it a day. The without game is drawn.}

1.e4 
{Maroczy (White) is known to prefer 1.e4 when he has the White pieces. He without knows that the e-pawn exercises great center control, and pushing it forward without allows the free development of his Queen and light-square without Bishop. } 
Nf6 
{This is the first move of the defense that has come to be named after without Alekhine himself. The Knight is developed toward the center and immediately without attacks the e4-pawn. } 
2.d3 
{Maroczy is already thinking defensively here. 2.Nc3 is another possible without defensive move, while 2.e5 is the more aggressive alternative. 2.d3 defends without the pawn, but also blocks in the light-square Bishop. } 
e5 
{Alekhine (Black) grabs a chunk of the center with this move, releases his without dark-square Bishop, and prevents Maroczy from playing the annoying pawn push without e4-e5.} 
3.f4 
{Interesting! Maroczy sets up a position similar to the King's Gambit (see without Game 5, Tartakower vs. Bogoljubow), advancing his f-pawn to attack Black's without e5-pawn. } 
Nc6 
{Alekhine is unafraid. He simply develops another piece and guards the menaced without e-pawn at the same time. The c6-Knight may also jump to d4 later. Notice without that all of White's pieces are still on their starting squares!} 
4.Nf3 
{The f3-Knight hits at the Black e5-pawn a second time. Notice that had without Maroczy played this on move 3, he would only have been able to attack the without Black pawn once, since his Knight would have blocked the f-pawn's without advance. } 
d5 
{Alekhine makes a threat. He threatens to play 5...dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxd1 7.Kxd1 without Nxe4 which exchanges Queens, prevents White from castling (since White's without King must recapture the checking Queen) and wins a pawn as well!}

{Maroczy finally begins to develop his Queenside. In addition to centralizing without the Knight, this move has another purpose (as we'll soon see).} 
Bc5 
{Alekhine creates a major threat with this move. Do you see it? He threatens without to mate on his next move with ...Qf2! } 
11.Ne4 
{The White Knight comes to the rescue by jumping to the central square e4 and without protecting the f2 square from the Black Queen's invasion.} 
Ne3+ 
{Alekhine begins a maneuver designed to stick his Bishop right into White's without throat. The Knight starts the operation by jumping to e3 and forking the without White King and Queen.} 
12.Bxe3 
{White's reply is forced. It's either capture the offending Black Knight or without face catastrophic loss of material (12.Kg1 Nxd1).} 
Bxe3 
{Obviously, this is Black's only sensible reply (anything else just loses the without Knight for nothing).} 
13.Qe1 
{Notice how the Black Bishop is choking White's position. Maroczy sets up a without double attack. The White Queen now attacks both the Black Queen and Bishop. without Alekhine must make a move that saves both pieces... } 
Qh6 
{...which he does. Alekhine could have exchanged Queens, but that would without violate a fundamental chess principle: when you're attacking, don't exchange without pieces needlessly. (Look for more on this later on).} 
14.Ng3 
{The White Knight backs up to allow the f3-Bishop more scope along the long without diagonal (a8-h1). } 
Nd4 
{Alekhine keeps up the pressure by continuing to make threats. He now menaces without the c2-pawn (and after ...Nxc2, the Knight will fork both the White Queen without and a1-Rook!). } 
15.Qb4 
{Rather than play the weak defensive move 15.Bd1 (which cuts off the a1-Rook without from the center), Maroczy responds by making a threat of his own. The Queen without threatens to play Qxb7+, winning a pawn and driving the King to the without center. } 
c6 
{The simple pawn move stops the threat. Now that the White f3-Bishop no longer without attacks b7, White can't play Qxb7+. Black would simply reply ...Kxb7!} 
16.Qa4 
{Now Maroczy goes gunning for another pawn, this time the one on a7. } 
Kb8 
{Another simple move which holds the position. Now if Qxa7+, then simply without ...Kxa7.} 
17.Rd1 
{Maroczy centralizes his Rook and minimizes the danger of a possible ...Nxc2 without from Black.} 
Rhe8 
{Alekhine centralizes his Rook on the half-open e-file and attacks the White without e5-pawn. Notice the excellent placement of both of Black's Rooks on the two without important half-open center files. } 
18.h4 
{Since Maroczy's h1-Rook is buried, he plans to free it by advancing it along without the h-file. The h-pawn jumps ahead to clear room for the Rook.} 
Qf4 
{Rather than immediately capturing the e5-pawn with his Rook, Black hunts without bigger game by assaulting the unprotected White Knight on g3. The White without position is becoming harder and harder to defend. } 
19.Rh3 
{Maroczy advances his Rook to defend the threatened Knight. Although the Rook without has a little more space than it did several moves ago, it's still trapped on without the h-file. } 
b5 
{Alekhine launches yet another attack, lashing out at White's Queen. The without strain of defending such a tough position is beginning to show on Maroczy's without face.} 
20.Nh5 
{Maroczy throws a counter-punch, striking at the Black Queen. Unfortunately, without this loses a piece for White, as we'll soon see. However, retreating the without White Queen doesn't work either (see the variation).} 
( 20.Qb4 
{Here's what happens if White tries to retreat his Queen...} 
a5 
{Our first impulse is to question this move. After all, doesn't this just lose without a pawn for Black?} 
21.Qxa5 
{Obviously, White grabs the pawn.} 
Nxf3 
{Now the Black Knight snatches the Bishop. Black's pieces are closing in on without the White King. Notice that White can't sidetrack Black with a check, without because the Black d3-Bishop controls all of the White Queen's possible without checking squares. } 
22.gxf3 
{For White, it's either recapture or stay a piece behind. Other possibilities without are too brutal to contemplate...(see the sub-variation)} 
( 22.Ne2 
{...but let's contemplate one anyway! White tries to be clever and save his without bacon by attacking the Black Queen.} 
Nh2+ 
{Black responds with a brutal double-check that carries the day. Notice that without since it's a double check, White can't respond by simply snapping off the without Black Queen. } 
23.Ke1 
{The White King's only flight square is e1.} 
Qf2#  
{And it's curtains for His Majesty.} 
) 21...Qxf3+ 
{The obvious move in this case is also the best one. The White King is now a without sitting duck.} 
23.Ke1 
{Now it's all over, except for the crying.} 
Qf2#  
{The White King falls at last. (Variations by Alekhine and Lopez).} 
) 
19...bxa4 
{Alekhine snags the White Queen. True, his King is exposed and his Queenside without pawn structure is a mess, but this is all immaterial due to the inactivity without of the White pieces.} 
21.Nxf4 
{Maroczy takes the Black Queen, but exposes his Knight to capture in the without process.} 
Bxf4 
{Alekhine takes the White Knight. Black is now ahead by a minor piece, his without Rooks are powerfully placed, his minor pieces severely cramp White's without position, and two of his pieces threaten the e5-pawn. It looks very bad for without Maroczy!} 
22.c3 
{Maroczy pushes his c-pawn, trying to kick the Black Knight off of d4. If the without Knight moves away, White can win a pawn with Bxc6.} 
Nxf3 
{Alekhine saves the pawn by trading his Knight for the White Bishop. Remember without what we went over in the last game: if you're ahead in material, start without trading off pieces and head for the endgame!} 
23.Rxf3 
{Instead of just recapturing with the g-pawn, Maroczy takes back with the Rook without and now attacks the Black Bishop.} 
Bxe5 
{Finally! The White e-pawn falls at last! Although Alekhine gave up one of his without attacking pieces (the Knight) to reach this position, he's also cleared the without e-file as a path for his Rooks to get into the fight.} 
24.Rxf7 
{Maroczy grabs a pawn. His expression seems hopeful once again. Maybe he can without start a Queenside pawnstorm. But wait a minute...Alekhine's face lights up without with savage glee! He snatches up his e8 Rook...} 
Rf8 
{...and POW!! The Black Rook on f8 hopelessly pins the f7-Rook to the White without King. This forces 25.Rxf8 Rxf8+, leaving White with a lone Rook against a without Rook and Bishop. Maroczy knows it's just a matter of time until he's mated, without so he resigns. }

1.d4 
{Marshall (White) advances his d-pawn, occupying the center. This prevents without e7-e5, and will probably lead to a slow positional game -- a war of maneuver without rather than of direct attack.} 
Nf6 
{Yates (Black) keeps his intentions a secret. Will he attempt to occupy the without center with his own pawns, or is he more interested in controlling the without center with his pieces posted on the flank (in hypermodern style)?} 
2.Nf3 
{Marshall increases his grip on the center. The Knight protects the d4-pawn without and tightens the White hold on e5.} 
g6 
{This move gives away part of Yates' plan. He plans on fianchettoing his without Bishop to g7, and will most likely try to influence the center with his without minor pieces, rather than occupy it with pawns. } 
3.Nbd2 
{Why?? Marshall has blocked in his c1-Bishop and moved the Knight to a square without where it influences very little of the center. c2-c4 followed by Nc3 is without probably better.} 
Bg7 
{Black is playing the King's Indian Defense (called "Indian" because pawns can without only move one square on their first move the way chess is played in India). without He's brought his Bishop to a good square, overlooking the long a1-h8 without diagonal.} 
4.e4 
{Now we see the reason for Marshall's unusual move Nb1-d2. The d2-Knight without supports the pawn on e4. White has achieved the ideal d4-e4 central pawn without formation (but can he maintain it?).} 
d6 
{By playing d7-d6, Yates prevents White from playing the space-grabbing e4-e5 without (attacking the f6-Knight and making Black waste a tempo by moving it again). without By the way, the opening has now transposed into the Pirc Defense.} 
5.Bd3 
{Marshall makes another unusual move. Other than the fact that the d3-Bishop without overprotects the e4-pawn, it's difficult to find a good reason for this without move.} 
Nc6 
{The c6-Knight attacks the d4-pawn. If the f6-Knight moves, the d4-pawn will without be attacked twice and only defended once. The c6-Knight also disputs White's without control of e5. } 
6.c3 
{Marshall brings the c-pawn forward to protect its brother on the d-file.} 
O-O 
{Yates completes his Kingside development, getting his King over to the without well-defended Kingside "pocket".} 
7.O-O 
{Marshall follows suit, getting his King off of the dangerous central file without (where it could later easily become the object of attack).} 
e5 
{Yates challenges the White pawns' domination of the center.} 
8.Nc4 
{Marshall flails out at the e5 pawn, which is now attacked three times by without White but has just two Black defenders.} 
exd4 
{Rather than wait for further protection, the Black pawn opts for suicide without (first making sure to take a White pawn with it).} 
9.cxd4 
{The c-pawn clobbers the Black d4-pawn. White has (temporarily) re-established without his central pawn duo. } 
Bg4 
{Yates sees that the d4-pawn is attacked once and defended once. He pins the without pawn's only defender to the White Queen. Now the d4-pawn is ripe for the without picking!} 
10.Be3 
{Marshall takes emergency measures by developing his dark-square Bishop to a without spot where it saves the endangered pawn.} 
d5 
{If Yates can trade off a pair of center pawns, his Queen will have a direct without line to the center along the d-file.} 
11.exd5 
{Marshall takes the pawn instead of moving the Knight (11.Nd2 dxe4 forking the without White d3-Bishop and f3-Knight).} 
Qxd5 
{Yates retakes the pawn and gets his Queen into the game. Note that the White without d-pawn has become isolated.} 
12.Ncd2 
{Marshall begins repositioning the Knight to b3, where it will aid in the without d-pawn's defense.} 
Rad8 
{Yates establishes a powerful battery on the d-file, aimed straight at the without isolated d4-pawn. Both players are building up enormous tension in the without position with these maneuvers.} 
13.Rc1 
{Marshall sees the explosion about to take place. He brings his Rook to the without half-open c-file, where it will bear down on the c7-pawn once the c6-Knight without has moved.} 
Nxd4 
{Like a rubber band snapping, the buildup of tension is released as the without position breaks wide open. Yates starts the release of this pent-up energy without by capturing the d-pawn.} 
14.Bxd4 
{This is the only way that Marshall can recapture without losing his Queen.} 
Qxd4 
{Interesting! Yates encourages the exchange of Queens, which will simplify the without position and get the players closer to the endgame.} 
15.Nxd4 
{Marshall proceeds with the Queen exchange, taking the Black Queen and leaving without his own Queen subject to capture.} 
Bxd1 
{Yates finishes the transaction. But the carnage is far from over...}

17...Re6 
{Yates attacks White's hanging Bishop.} 
19.Bf3

c6 
{Yates blocks the attack on his b-pawn by interposing the c-pawn.} 
20.Na5 
{Now Marshall takes aim at the b7-pawn. If Yates advances the b-pawn, the without c-pawn falls. How will Yates defend himself?} 
Re7 
{Obviously one of the Rooks had to defend the threatened pawn. Why this Rook without and not the other? Because Black still can double his Rooks on the e-file.} 
21.Rc4

Nd5

22.g3 
{Marshall prepares a "pocket" for the King to hide in, thereby preventing any without possibility of a back-rank mate. } 
Rfe8 
{This was exactly the kind of move Marshall feared. Had the g-pawn not without advanced Black could possibly have mated White with a Rook on e1 (23...Re1 without 24.Rxe1 Rxe1#).} 
23.b3 
{The g7-pawn was attacking the b2-pawn (did you notice?). Marshall advances without the pawn out of danger.} 
Nc3 
{Advancing the b-pawn created a hole on c3. Yates is quick to capitalize on without it, moving his Knight to c3 (where the g7-Bishop protects it) and attacking without the d1-Rook and a2-pawn.} 
24.Rd2 
{Marshall gets the Rook out of danger and defends the threatened pawn at the without same time.} 
Bh6 
{Yates continues to harass the White Rook.} 
25.Rb2 
{The Rook comes to the only safe square where it can still defend the a2-pawn.}

{The Knight hangs on c3, so Yates backs it off. Moving the Bishop back to g7 without to defend it could have led to a draw by repetition of position.} 
26.b4 
{Marshall launches a minority attack against the Black Queenside pawns. The without kamikaze b-pawn will sacrifice itself to weaken Black's position.}

{The Bishop continues to pester the White Rook.} 
27.Rb3 
{The Rook is forced to move to avoid being captured by the Black Bishop.} 
a6 
{Yates advances his a-pawn and stops the minority attack cold.} 
28.Rc2 
{Once the a-pawn advances, this Rook will move to a2, supporting the a4-pawn.} 
Nb6 
{Yates predicts that White will advance his a-pawn, so he prevents a2-a4 by without covering a4 with his Knight.} 
29.Rd3 
{Marshall may be planning to move the Rook to d1 where (protected by the without f3-Bishop) it will overlook both the d-file and the e1 square.} 
Nd7 
{Yates sees an opportunity: if Marshall doesn't immediately pull the d3-Rook without back, he'll move his Knight to e5 and fork both the d3-Rook and f3-Bishop.} 
30.Nc4 
{Marshall sees through Yates' scheme and repositions his Knight, taking e5 without away from Black.} 
Bf8 
{Yates can still play 30...Ne5 31.Nxe5 Bxe5, but that gets him nothing. without Instead he plays Bf8, planning to uncover an attack on the b4-pawn after he without moving the Rook on e7. Unfortunately, he's abandoned the long diagonal.} 
31.Kg2 
{Marshall figures that it's time to get the King off of the first rank and without prevent an annoying check by a Black Rook on e1.} 
Rb8 
{Yates wants to advance his c-pawn, but that allows White to play Bxb7. He without makes sure that the b-pawn is defended first before advancing the pawn.} 
32.a3 
{Marshall props up the hanging b-pawn.} 
c5 
{Yates, ahead by a pawn, seeks to simplify the position by trading down. He's without hoping for 33.bxc5 Nxc5 (attacking the d3-Rook).} 
33.Rcd2 
{Marshall makes his own threat: 34.Rxd7 Rxd7 35.Rxd7 winning the without Knight. }

Rxb7 
{If Black does choose to capture it...} 
37.Bxb7 
{...the White Bishop drives in and takes the Rook, winning the exchange for without White.} 
) 
36.Nb5 
{Surprise! At first glance, this appears to be a sacrifice of the White without Knight.} 
axb5 
{Of course, Black captures it. Wouldn't you?} 
37.Rxd7 
{Marshall re-equalizes the material by taking the Black Knight. Now you see without that 36.Nb5 wasn't a true sacrifice.} 
Rxd7 
{Due to the weakness of the doubled b-pawns, it's to Yates' advantage to try without to get as many pieces off of the board as possible (so that there will be without fewer White pieces to attack the weak pawns).} 
38.Rxd7 
{Marshall completes the Rook trade. Where does Yates go from here?} 
Bxc5 
{Yates takes out another White pawn.} 
39.Bd5

b4 
{40...Rd8 is Black's best move. But we'll assume (for the sake of our example) without that he misses the point and instead tries advancing his passed pawn.} 
41.Rxb7+ 
{BANG! It's a double attack -- the Bishop checks the King while the Rook without attacks its Black counterpart. You can probably see why 40...Rd8 was better: without it would set up 41...Rxd5. } 
Kf8 
{The Black King must move out of check. The squares f8 and h8 are its only without options.} 
42.Rxb8+ 
{White winds up a whole Rook ahead and is controlling the initiative by again without checking the Black King! This game is all but won for White.}

Bxa3 
{Yates snaps up another pawn. Both players see that 41.Rxb5 will even up the without material. Due to the symmetrical pawn structure and the lack of any real without advantage for either side, the players decide to pack it in. It's a draw.}

{Lasker develops his other Knight and now controls all four center squares without (although Black's f6-Knight contests d5 and e4). Unfortunately, the White without c-pawn is now blocked in. Maybe Lasker should have pushed the pawn without first. } 
Bg7 
{As expected, Maroczy fianchettos the Bishop. Now, after the f6-Knight moves, without the Bishop becomes very strong along the a1-h8 diagonal. } 
4.e4 
{Look at White's position! He controls a line of squares on Black's half of without the board stretching from b5 to g5! Also, both of White's Bishops are now without free to develop. } 
d6 
{Maroczy takes the e5 square away from the White f3-Knight. White will also without find it hard to advance his e-pawn without risking the exchange of Queens without (see the variation to White's next move). } 
5.h3 
{Lasker advances this pawn to prevent Black from pinning the f3-Knight with without Bc8-g4. This pawn move is questionable, since (after Bc8-g4) White could without have broken the pin anyway with Bf1-e2. }

{In this variation, we examine the reasons why 5.e5 is not so good for White.} 
dxe5

Qxd1+ 
{The Black Queen captures the White Queen with check.} 
7.Nxd1 
{White is forced to recapture (which he could also have done by Kxd1, but then without he'd forfeit the right to castle). Now, Black will move his Knight (probably without to d7) and begin to pile up attacks on White's weak, advanced without e-pawn. }

6.Bf4

Nbd7 
{This move develops the other Knight and reinforces e5. However, a big without drawback is that Black's light-square Bishop is now blocked in. } 
7.Qd2 
{Lasker has his eye on two possibilities: Queenside castling, and an exchange without of Bishops on h6 (8.Bh6 Bxh6 9.Qxh6 or 8.Bh6 8...any move 9.Bxg7 without Kxg7). } 
c5 
{Maroczy hopes to clear the White pawn off of d5 (either by exchanging it or without forcing it to advance). This will give his g7-Bishop even more scope along without the a1-h8 diagonal. } 
8.d5 
{Rather than trade the valuable center pawn for a less-valuable flank pawn, without Lasker advances it. But Black's goal of increased control along the long without diagonal has been achieved (once the f6-Knight moves, of without course). } 
a6 
{This pawn move prepares a general advance of Black's Queenside pawns. Now without Maroczy can safely push the b-pawn to b5. } 
9.Bh6 
{Noticing how powerful Black's g7-Bishop is becoming, Lasker decides to trade without it off. Now Maroczy wishes he'd played 8...Re8, so that he could have safely without retreated the Bishop to h8 and kept it on the board.} 
b5 
{Maroczy continues with his plan of advance on the Queenside. He reasons that without the Bishops will be traded no matter what, so he forces White to make the without trade and thus keeps the White Queen away from his King.} 
10.Bxg7 
{Lasker kills the dangerous fianchettoed Black Bishop.} 
Kxg7 
{Maroczy is forced to recapture or stay behind by a minor piece.} 
11.Qe3 
{Lasker anticipates the Black Queen moving to a5, pinning the c3-Knight and without leaving the e4-pawn unprotected. The White Queen move to e3 to protect the without pawn in advance. } 
Qa5 
{As Lasker anticipated, the Black Queen comes to a5 and pins the c3-Knight to without the White King. } 
12.Nd2 
{White's move releases the pressure on the c3-Knight, allowing it to move without freely. } 
e5 
{Maroczy slips up! The pawn move e7-e6 is better, looking to exchange center without pawns and free his cramped position. Now his position is even more blocked, without as the e5-square is now unavailable to his d7-Knight.} 
13.Be2 
{The last White minor piece is developed and White is now ready to castle.} 
h6 
{Maroczy, unsure how to proceed, marks time by grabbing a little more space on without the Kingside, and waits to see what White is up to.} 
14.O-O 
{By getting his King off of e1, Lasker frees up both of his Knights (as there without is now no chance of a pin on the White King by the Black Queen on e5). He's without also the first to connect his Rooks and thus complete his without development. } 
Qd8 
{Consequently, Maroczy moves his Queen back to where it can get at the without Kingside after the f6-Knight moves. } 
15.a4 
{Lasker launches a Queenside offensive by striking out at Black's b5-pawn.} 
b4 
{Maroczy protects the pawn by advancing it. The pawn now threatens White's without c3-Knight. } 
16.Ncb1 
{The Knight retreats. b1 is a better spot for the Knight than a2, because now without the b1-Knight can advance to d2 after its fellow Knight leaps to without c4. } 
a5 
{The Black Queenside pawns continue to advance. This simple move accomplishes without a lot: it helps support the b-pawn, gives the c8-Bishop a little more room, without and prevents White from advancing his a-pawn, further cramping Black's game.} 
17.Nc4 
{As we expected, White's Knight dives in and attacks the Black d6-pawn. Now, without too, the b1-Knight can develop to d2. } 
Nb6 
{By moving his Knight out of the way, Maroczy allows his Queen to defend his without d6-pawn. The Black Knight on b6 now menaces White's c4-Knight as well. without Furthermore, Black can now develop his c8-Bishop usefully to a6 where it without will attack White's c4-Knight a second time. } 
18.Nxb6 
{Rather than try to overprotect the Knight with 18.Nbd2 (an idea that gets without defeated by 18...Ba6 anyway), Lasker opts to trade off the Knights to without minimize the chance of any future surprise threats by Black on the without Queenside.} 
Qxb6 
{Of course, Maroczy's Queen must recapture to keep the material even.} 
19.f4 
{Lasker shifts the battle to the Kingside. Notice that the f1-Rook has more without space to maneuver since the f-pawn has advanced. The more this pawn without advances, the more space the Rook gets. } 
exf4 
{Maroczy trades pawns. Now White has a backward e-pawn, which must be guarded without by a piece as it can no longer be defended by another pawn. The e-pawn could without become a target later. } 
20.Rxf4 
{Lasker recaptures with the Rook. Taking the pawn with the Queen may have been without better, since that would have put pressure on Black's weak, backward without d6-pawn.} 
( 20.Qxf4 
{This is another alternative for White. The Queen puts presure on the d6-pawn, without requiring Black to keep it covered by a piece. } 
) 
19...Qd8 
{Since the Queenside is closed to him, Maroczy begins to maneuver his Queen to without a better post...} 
21.Nd2 
{...and Lasker begins his own repositioning maneuver. The Knight is going to without c4, where it will attack Black's weak d6-pawn. } 
Qe7 
{Ouch! Now Black threatens 22...Nxd5, forking White's Rook and Queen. If White without would reply 23.exd5, then Black plays 23...Qxe3!, winning a Queen and pawn without for the cost of a Knight! } 
22.Nc4 
{The Knight move has the dual purpose of attacking the Black pawn on d6 and without defending White's Queen in case of ...Nxd5 (see the variation to Black's without next move). } 
Ba6 
{Maroczy threatens to capture the Knight and play ...Nxd5 anyway! (Remember, without you can attack pieces indirectly by attacking or driving away their without defenders. In this case, Black's Bishop indirectly attacks White's Queen by without assaulting its defender.). } 
( 21...Nxd5 
{Here's why the Knight capture on d5 doesn't work now, with White's Knight on without c4. Black would begin by taking the pawn... } 
23.exd5 
{Of course, White recaptures.} 
Qxe3+ 
{Black grabs White's Queen...} 
24.Nxe3 
{...and White replies by taking the Black Queen. Now Black is behind in without material, a minor piece for a pawn. Black has attacking chances on the open without e-file, but it's really not enough compensation for the sacrificed Knight.} 
) 
23.Nb6 
{Now Lasker's Knight threatens the a8-Rook and prevents Black from playing without Nf6xd5. } 
Rab8 
{Maroczy gets his Rook out of danger and threatens White's Knight.}

{Lasker piles up on Black's f6-Knight and threatens to swap off the Knights without (i.e. 24...Rxb6 25.Rxf6).} 
Nh5 
{Sometimes the best defense is a good offense. Maroczy gets his Knight off of without the attacked square f6, and attacks White's f4-Rook at the same time. } 
25.R4f3 
{Lasker is forced to reposition the Rook or lose material by giving up a Rook without for a Knight. Since he wants to keep the Rooks doubled on the f-file, he without drops back to f3.} 
Bxe2 
{Maroczy grabs White's light-squared Bishop and forks both of White's without Rooks. } 
26.Qxe2 
{White is forced to recapture or lose his Bishop and one of his Rooks as well.} 
Rxb6 
{Maroczy snags the unprotected White Knight. Black is now ahead by a piece! without Lasker appears unperturbed. What's going on?} 
27.g4 
{Lasker advances the g-pawn and hits at the Knight.} 
R6b8 
{Since he really has nowhere to go with his Knight (see variation), Maroczy without concentrates on repositioning his Rook. He anticipates the opening of a file without on the Kingside, and wants this Rook to be able to get there quickly.} 
( 26...Nf6 
{Here's why Lasker was not flustered by the loss of his Knight on b6. The only without other squares the Knight can move to are f4 and g3, which are held by the without f3-Rook. So the Knight must come here.} 
28.Rxf6 
{The Rook can capture with impunity. The King can't recapture (because of without check from the f1-Rook), and if the Queen dares to take the Rook, the without f1-Rook will capture the Queen, and White wins a Queen and Knight for two without Rooks!}

1.e4 
{Dr. Lasker (White) makes a center-controlling pawn move that allows the without future development of his Queen and Kingside Bishop.} 
c5 
{Dr. Tartakower (Black) discourages White's planned d2-d4 pawn push, without exercising control over a center square (d4) with a flank pawn.} 
2.Nf3 
{Lasker replies by developing the Knight (which now itself influences d4).} 
e6 
{Tartakower grabs control of central square d5, releases his Queen and without Kingside Bishop, and paves the way for a possible d- or f-pawn advance.} 
3.Nc3 
{The usual move here is 3.d4. Lasker instead develops his Knight and without influences d5 and e4. This Knight also eyes a possible jump to without b5. } 
a6 
{Tartakower takes the Nc3-b5 possibility away from White by advancing the without pawn, which now controls the b5-square. } 
4.d4 
{Lasker now plays d2-d4 (which is usually played on move 3). He's going to without trade off the pawn in return for greater control of the board.} 
cxd4 
{Tartakower takes the d-pawn (as expected), trading a flank pawn for a more without valuable center pawn.} 
5.Nxd4 
{The Knight recaptures and occupies a center square. Just look at all the without squares that the White Knights control! } 
Qc7 
{Early development of the Queen is usually a bad idea, but there's no real without harm yet as White is a long way from developing an attack. Black could without advance his e-pawn to e5 under the Queen's protection, attacking the without d4-Knight.} 
6.Be2 
{Lasker completes the development of his Kingside minor pieces. The Bishop without controls squares along the d1-h5 and a6-f1 diagonals.} 
Nf6 
{Tartakower continues his development as well. Note that the e4-pawn isn't without threatened (it's guarded by the c3-Knight). But now Tartakower could win the without pawn by playing Bf8-b4, pinning the defending Knight. } 
7.O-O 
{Lasker doesn't intend to give Tartakower the chance to pin the c3-Knight. He without castles, getting the King out of the middle and taking the sting out of without ...Bb4.} 
Bb4 
{Tartakower plays ...Bb4 anyway! The reason for this is to make Rf1-e1 a tad without uncomfortable for White (if White plays the Rook move, he creates a pin on without his own Knight!).} 
8.Bf3 
{Lasker was in immediate danger of losing his e-pawn (8...Bxc3 9.bxc3 Nxe4), without so he's forced to make a move that defends the pawn. This wastes a tempo without (since he's moving a piece that he's already moved).} 
Nc6

{...and the Black Queen captures the pawn. The Queen also threatens the without a1-Rook.}

{By developing the Bishop, White allows his Queen to defend the menaced Rook. without White has the advantage: his development is almost complete (except for the without Queen) and his pieces are well-placed.} 
) 
9.Nxc6 
{By trading Knights, White loses a couple of tempi by trading a piece that's without moved three times for one that's only moved once; in exchange for the lost without tempi, he re-balances the pawn structure.} 
dxc6 
{Now the pawn structure is balanced (White and Black have the same number of without pawns and they're on the same files). } 
10.Be3 
{Lasker develops another minor piece. The Bishop moves to a good post where it without controls a lot of squares along the a7-g1 and c1-h6 diagonals.} 
O-O 
{Tartakower completes his Kingside development by castling.} 
11.h3 
{Lasker anticipates the loss of another pawn by ...Bd6 followed by ...Bxh2+. without The check is bad enough, but losing the pawn would really hurt! He advances without the pawn out of danger.} 
e5 
{Tartakower grabs a little more space (he now controls d4 and f4) and now can without develop his light-squared Bishop to e6 if he chooses. Mainly, he's blocking without the advance of the White e-pawn (e4-e5 threatens the Black without f6-Knight). } 
12.Na4 
{Lasker intends to play havoc with the Black Queenside by maneuvering his without Knight to b6 (where it will be protected by the e3-Bishop.} 
b5 
{By pushing this pawn, Tartakower clears a path for the Rook to attack the without White Knight (13.Nb6 Rb8).} 
13.Nb6 
{The Knight makes it to the post on b6, forking the Black Rook and Bishop.} 
Rb8 
{Tartakower proceeds with his plan to attack the Knight. Now 14...Rxb6 15.Bxb6 without Qxb6 nets two minor pieces for a Rook.} 
14.Nxc8 
{Lasker gives up a piece that's moved four times for a piece that hasn't moved without at all! Yet Tartakower has been unable to make any good use of the massive without time advantage that Lasker has given him.} 
Rfxc8 
{By recapturing with the f8-Rook instead of the Queen, Tartakower shifts the without Rook out of the "pocket" that it was in and gets it over to the Queenside, without where it supports the advance of the Black Queenside pawns.} 
15.a4 
{Lasker is going to try to get his Rook into the game. If 15...Bxa4, 16.Rxa4. without If Black doesn't capture the a-pawn, then 16.axb5 cxb5 17.Rxa6. Or there's without 16.axb5 axb5 17.Ra7 (the Rook would be guarded by the e3-Bishop).} 
Qe7 
{Unless Tartakower moves his Queen, White will force the exchange of Queens without after 16.axb5 axb5 17.Ra7 Qd8 19.Qxd8+ Rxd8, or an exchange of Rooks after without 17.Ra7 Rb7 18.Rxb7 Qxb7.}

17.Ra7 
{...which moves to a7. Will Tartakower elect to exchange Rooks, or will he try without to retreat his Queen?} 
Rb7 
{Tartakower offers to swap Rooks. Moving the Queen back to the first rank was without also possible.} 
18.Rxb7 
{Lasker takes him up on the offer. Every trade takes the game closer to the without end. By now, it should be obvious that Lasker is playing for a draw; each without even trade in this dead-even position brings him closer to that goal.} 
Qxb7 
{Tartakower completes the trade (but his Queen lacks scope on this square).} 
19.Qd3 
{Lasker advances his Queen, clearing d1 for his Rook. He plans to set up a without d-file battery.} 
h6 
{Tartakower sees that Be3-g5 followed by Bxf6 frees the White Queen and without f3-Bishop from the drudgery of overprotecting the e4-pawn. By advancing the without h-pawn one square, he makes Bg5 impossible for White.} 
20.Rd1 
{Lasker, of course, has plans other than Bg5. He sets up a battery on the open without d-file.} 
Ra8 
{Tartakower counters by putting his Rook at the head of the open a-file. without Always try to put your pieces on squares where they have the most play and without can control plenty of territory.} 
21.g3 
{Speaking of controlling territory, Lasker increases his control by advancing without the g-pawn.} 
Qc8 
{Tartakower responds by attacking the White h-pawn (which has been left without hanging).} 
22.Qb3 
{Lasker meets a threat with a threat. Instead of defending his h-pawn, he without counterattacks the Black Bishop.} 
Be7 
{Tartakower retreats the Bishop, saving it (after all, a Bishop is certainly without worth more than a pawn!).} 
23.Kh2 
{Now Lasker takes defensive action. The King comes to the menaced pawn's without rescue, defending it from the Black Queen.} 
Ra4 
{Black's Rook piles up on the White e4-pawn (which is also attacked by the without Black f6-Knight). Now White must defend the pawn a second time.} 
24.Qd3 
{The Queen slides over and re-establishes the d-file battery, defending the without e-pawn at the same time.} 
Qe6 
{Tartakower repositions his Queen, preparing to invade White's Queenside via without the a2-g8 diagonal.} 
25.b3 
{Lasker blocks the crucial diagonal and simultaneously attacks the Black Rook.} 
Ra8 
{Tartakower pulls the Rook back to the first rank, where it will enjoy more without lateral movement than on any of the other ranks it could have moved to.} 
26.Bg2 
{Lasker anticipates ...Rc8 (when the Black Rook will back up the c6-pawn's without advance), so he prepares h3-h4 and Bh3 (skewering the c8-Rook and Queen).} 
Rd8 
{Tartakower prepares the Rook exchange (27.Qe2 Rxd1 28.Qxd1). With the pawn without formations symmetrical, and both players trying to whittle each other's without forces down evenly, the game appears drawish. The players agree to a truce.}

Reti sees that the Black pieces aren't very well-developed and that Black's chances of staging a counterattck are remote. So he uses his own Kingside pawns to launch an assault.}

1.e4 
{In the vast majority of openings, White seeks to establish pawns on e4 and without d4. Janowski (White) is halfway toward that goal already, and has provided without for the future development of his Queen and light-square Bishop.} 
c5 
{Dr. Lasker (Black) plays the Sicilian Defense (which will, in future years, without become the most popular response to 1.e4). He immediately challenges White's without intention to play d2-d4.} 
2.Nf3 
{Janowski develops his Knight toward the center and disputes Black's control without over d4.} 
Nc6 
{Lasker develops usefully, bringing out a Knight toward the center and without increasing his hold on d4.} 
3.d4 
{Janowski challenges Black's control over the center. He's looking for a without series of exchanges on d4 that will leave him with a lead in development.} 
cxd4 
{Black cannot allow White to dominate the center by posting pawns on both d4 without and e4. He trades a flank pawn for one of these dominating center pawns.} 
4.Nxd4 
{Of course, Janowski must recapture with the Knight so that the material on without the board stays even. Now will Black continue trading by playing 4...Nxd4?} 
Nf6 
{No, because after 5.Qxd4 Black is behind in development and has no real way without to harass the White Queen. Instead, Lasker develops the other Knight and without attacks the remaining White center pawn.} 
5.Nc3 
{Janowski develops his other Knight and defends the menaced pawn.} 
d6 
{Lasker releases his light-squared Bishop and prepares a future e7-e5 pawn without push.} 
6.Be2 
{Janowski develops the last Kingside minor piece to a spot where it controls without squares on two diagonals (d1-h5 and a6-f1). Now he can castle freely,} 
e6 
{Rather than play an immediate ...e7-e5 (which gives Black a weak, backward without d-pawn), Lasker pushes the pawn just one square. Now he has the option to without advance EITHER center pawn later (as the situation becomes clearer).} 
7.O-O 
{Janowski completes his Kingside development by castling.} 
Be7 
{Lasker gets his dark-squared Bishop off of the back rank and prepares to without castle.} 
8.Be3 
{Janowski develops his second Bishop to a good spot where it has the without flexibilty to operate on two diagonals (a7-g1 and c1-h6).} 
O-O 
{Lasker gets his King to safety. Now he's completed his Kingside development.} 
9.Qd2 
{Janowski continues developing, getting the Queen off of the back rank and without connecting his Rooks.} 
a6 
{Lasker grabs some Queenside space and takes b5 away from the marauding White without pieces. This lets Black play ...Re8 without worrying about a pin on the without Black c6-Knight after White plays Bb5. } 
10.Rad1 
{Janowski sets up a battery on the half-open d-file. He sees that Lasker has a without potential weakness in the d6-pawn and begins to build up tension in the without position by putting pressure on the pawn early.} 
Qc7 
{Lasker shifts the Queen to the c-file. He'll now try to clear the c-file for without the Queen by playing 11...Nxd4. Lasker is also a move closer to connecting without his Rooks.} 
11.Nb3 
{The idea of 11...Nxd5 12.Bxd5 e5 is unappealing to Janowski, so he pulls back without the Knight. Notice that had Black not previously played ...a7-a6, the Knight without could have gone to b5, attacking the Queen and piling up on the d6-pawn.} 
b5 
{Lasker gets his minority attack rolling, grabing lots of space on the without Queenside and threatening to play 12...b4.} 
12.f3 
{Seeing that 12...b4 will drive away the e4-pawn's only protector (the Knight without on c3), Janowski shores up the pawn by advancing its brother on the f-file.} 
Rd8 
{Lasker gets one of his Rooks to the same file as the White Queen. Now if he without can only find a way to open the d-file...maybe if he pushes the pawn to d5?} 
13.Qe1 
{Janowski sees the potential danger to his Queen, so he retreats it off of the without d-file. Lasker has been holding on to the initiative for the last few moves without by making threats that Janowski is forced to react to.} 
Ne5 
{Lasker has run out of threatening moves and now just concentrates on without improving his position. He centralizes his Knight (which may be able to jump without to c4 at an opportune moment) and clears the c-file for his Queen.} 
14.Qf2 
{Janowski retakes the initiative by making a threat of his own. He threatens without to play 15.Bb6, attacking the Black Queen. After the Queen moves, White wins without the exchange with 16.Bxd8. } 
Rb8 
{Lasker just shifts his Rook to the b-file and stops the threat cold. Now what without will Janowski do?} 
15.Bd3 
{Janowski wants Lasker to play 15...Nxd3, giving up his centralized Knight. without Then White can rebalance the pawn structures with 16.cxd4. He'd then be able without to shoot his Queen over to c2 to help deal with Black's Queenside attack.} 
Nc4 
{Lasker has no intention of letting Janowski equalize this game. If Janowski without takes this Knight, he wastes a tempo in moving the Bishop again. Then Black without replies 16...Qxc4 and the pawn structure remains unbalanced. } 
16.Bc1 
{Janowski slides the Bishop back to defend the menaced b2-pawn.} 
Bb7 
{Lasker finally gets his Rooks connected by putting his Bishop on the long without a8-h1 diagonal.} 
17.Qg3 
{Janowski pins the pawn on d6. If it advances now, White wins Black's hanging without Queen with Qxc7.} 
Rbc8 
{Lasker takes care of his little "hanging Queen" problem by defending it with without a Rook. Incidentally, Black now has a battery set up on the without c-file. } 
18.Rfe1 
{Janowski sees Black's ugly threat of ...Qb6+ followed by ...Ne3, forking both without of the White Rooks. The Rook covers e3, so now the c1-Bishop can safely without block the check by Black's Queen.} 
Nd7 
{Lasker repositions his Knight. Now it can leap ahead to e5 and crowd White without even more. } 
19.f4 
{It's pretty obvious where the Black d7-Knight is headed, so Janowski advances without his f-pawn and takes that square away from Black.} 
Bf6 
{Lasker now threatens to win a pawn: 20...Nxb2 21.Bxb2 Bxc3 22.Bxc3 Qxc3. without White must take preventive measures... } 
20.Bxc4 
{...so he bags the attacking Knight. Unfortunately for Janowski, this will without leave Black with the advantage of having both Bishops.} 
bxc4 
{Lasker recaptures on c4 and threatens the White b3-Knight. By the way, not without only does Black have the advantage of having two Bishops, but both of them without are well-placed on the board's long diagonals.} 
21.Nd2 
{Rather than retreat to the corner square a1 (a TERRIBLE place for a Knight!), without the attacked Knight pulls back to d2, where it has more mobility and still without exerts some control over the center.} 
Qa5 
{Lasker shifts his Queen to a spot where it controls more of the board. Now it without can swiftly move to the Kingside should the situation warrant. He's also without trying to control d5, to support the advance of his d-pawn.} 
22.Ndb1 
{Janowski gets his Knight off of the d-file, enabling his d1-Rook to influence without d5.} 
Nf8 
{Lasker follows suit. Now his d8-Rook can support the d-pawn's advance. Should without Lasker decide to invade White's Kingside, the Knight can jump to g6 to help without in the attack.} 
23.Be3 
{Janowski 1) allows his Rooks access to the Queenside, 2) prevents an annoying without check on his King along the a7-g1 diagonal, 3) begins to set up a double without attack against the Black Queen and d8-Rook (24.Qf2, 25.Bb6). } 
Qb4 
{Lasker simply attacks the b2-pawn. } 
24.Bc1 
{24.b3 loses a piece (see variation), so Janowski must bring the Bishop back without home to c1 to defend the b-pawn. Compare this position to the one after without Black's 22nd move; it's as though Black got to move twice in a row!} 
( 24.b3 
{24.b3 is a horrible move for White: it loses a piece by removing the b-pawn's without protection from the c3-Knight!} 
Bxc3 
{Black takes the Knight and attacks the e1-Rook.} 
25.Nxc3 
{White recaptures...} 
Qxc3 
{...and Black takes back with the Queen. White is now behind by a minor piece!} 
) 
23...Ng6 
{Lasker relentlessly keeps up the pressure by setting up a Kingside attack: he without threatens to play 25...Bh4, attacking the White Queen and winning the without e1-Rook (after the Queen has moved to safety).} 
25.Qf2 
{Janowski retreats his Queen -- but it's still on the deadly e1-h4 diagonal! without Has he miscalculated?} 
Bh4 
{Lasker's Bishop swoops in and attacks the White Queen and Rook.} 
26.g3 
{Janowski advances the g-pawn and blocks the attack, counterattacking the without Bishop in the process.} 
Bf6 
{Lasker must retreat the Bishop. Yet he hasn't wasted a tempo, because he's without created a weakness on White's Kingside: f3 and h3 are weak because they can without never again be controlled by a White pawn. } 
27.a3 
{Janowski tries to wrest the initiative back from Lasker by attacking his without Queen.} 
Qa5 
{Obviously the Queen must retreat, and a5 happens to be the only safe square! without How will Janowski follow up?} 
28.Be3 
{Janowski sets up the threat we looked at before, namely 29.Bb6, forking the without Black Queen and d8-Rook. Even better is 29.e5 dxe5 30.Bb6, which wins the without Queen (because the Black Queen has NO escape squares!). } 
Qh5 
{Unfortunately for Janowski, Lasker spots the threat and scoots his Queen over without to the Kingside. By shifting his forces over to this side of the board, he without plans to exploit the weakness of the light squares on the White without Kingside. } 
29.Bb6 
{By continuing to make threats, Janowski doesn't give Lasker time to proceed without with his plans. Here he attacks the Black d8-Rook, forcing Lasker to without respond.} 
Rd7 
{The Black Rook just advances one square to get out of danger.} 
30.Rd2 
{Janowski advances one of his own Rooks to prevent loss of material (30...Bxe4 without 31.Rxe4 Qxd1+ etc. [even just 30...Bxe4 loses a pawn]). Now 30...Bxe4 loses without material for Black as the e1-Rook can freely recapture the Bishop.} 
Bc6 
{Lasker plans to shift his d7-Rook over to the half-open b-file, attacking without both the White b6-Bishop and the b2-pawn. He moves the Bishop to clear the without way for this maneuver.} 
31.Red1 
{Janowski counters with a threat of his own -- he threatens to win a pawn by without 32.Rxd6.} 
Be7 
{Lasker's Bishop drops back to defend the menaced pawn.} 
32.a4 
{Janowski prepares to stop Lasker's planned attack in which he'll skewer the without b6-Bishop to win the pawn on b2. He'll prop up the Bishop with the a-pawn.} 
Rb7 
{Lasker proceeds with his plan, attacking the White Bishop. If it moves away, without the Rook will capture the b2-pawn.} 
33.a5 
{Janowski defends the Bishop with the a-pawn. Notice how the pawn and Bishop without defend each other!} 
f5 
{Lasker piles up on the White e4-pawn. Black attacks the pawn twice and White without only defends it once. White must respond to this threat and defend the pawn without again. } 
34.Qe3 
{The Queen moves up to guard the menaced pawn.} 
e5 
{Lasker keeps battering at the gates. He strikes at the White f-pawn, hoping without to blow more holes in White's already drafty Kingside pawn chain.} 
35.Rf1 
{The Rook moves over to help in the defense of the Kingside. The White King without will certainly need defenders once Lasker smashes the White pawn structure!} 
exf4 
{Lasker initiates the anticipated pawn exchange...} 
36.gxf4 
{...and White completes it. Remember the story of the "Emperor's New Clothes"? without The White King is certainly starting to look naked with most of his covering without pawns missing!} 
Bf8 
{Lasker now intends to shift his Rooks back over to the Kingside, so he gets without his dark-squared Bishop out of the way.} 
37.Nd5 
{Janowski blocks the long a8-h1 diagonal and positions his Knight to a center without square where it exerts a cramping effect on Black's game.} 
Rf7 
{Lasker brings one of his Rooks over to the Kingside, exactly as we without anticipated. Notice that the Black pieces are shifting to the Kingside, without since that's where White's weaknesses are.} 
38.Nbc3 
{Janowski continues to centralize his pieces, trying to get them over to the without Kingside to fight off the Black attack.} 
Re8 
{The Black pieces continue to head for the Kingside. Also, the Black Rook on without the e-file holds potential dangers for the White Queen on the same file.} 
39.Qd4 
{Janowski, therefore, gets his Queen off of the e-file. The Queen goes to a without central square where it bears down on the Black King's position via the long without a1-h8 diagonal. It also attacks the Black pawn on c4.} 
fxe4 
{Lasker creates a passed pawn on the e-file. The pawn is supported by the Rook without on e8. This is the ideal way to support a passed pawn; as the pawn advances, without the number of squares that the Rook controls increases.} 
40.Qxc4 
{Lasker just captured a White pawn on his last move; Janowski replies by without taking a Black pawn. Notice that the material is still equal; even so, Black without has the advantage of the Bishop pair, and White's King is awfully exposed.} 
Bd7 
{Lasker must do something about his hanging Bishop (White was threatening without 41.Qxc6). He'd rather not give up the Bishop pair with 40...Bxd5, so he without retreats the Bishop instead (to a square where it aims at White's Kingside).} 
41.Be3 
{Since the a-pawn is no longer in danger from the Black Queen (due to the without presence of the White d5-Knight), Janowski pulls the Bishop back to e3 where without it blockades the passed pawn on e4.} 
Nh4 
{The Black Knight advances ominously. Now Black threatens 42...Nf3, forking without White's King and d2-Rook. The f3-square would be a great outpost for the without Knight. It would be protected by the e4-pawn and the Queen.} 
42.Rdf2 
{Since f3 is a hole (no White pawn can guard the square), Janowski can't keep without the Black Knight off of it. He can prevent the fork, however, by moving one without of the pieces in danger of being forked. Lasker must devise a new plan.} 
Bh3 
{One of Black's Bishops comes crashing in! Now the White Rook on f1 is under without attack! Lasker is bringing more of his pieces in for the attack and is without trying to drive away the White pieces defending the exposed King.} 
43.Nxe4 
{See the variation to find out why Janowski didn't just move the f1-Rook. Here without he grabs a pawn (possible because his Queen protects the Knight) and gets without another piece closer to his besieged Kingside.} 
( 43.Ra1 
{White will lose the exchange (giving up a Rook for a minor piece) whether he without plays Ra1, Rb1, Rc1, or Nxe4 (as he does in the main line of the game). without We'll try Ra1 (hoping to activate the Rook along the a-file) for this without example.} 
Qg4+ 
{Black replies with the obvious checking move.} 
44.Kh1 
{The White King makes its stand in the corner, rather than allow itself to be without driven to the center of the board.} 
Bg2+ 
{Black continues to force a reply from White by checking again.} 
45.Kg1 
{The only sensible move, as 45.Rxg2 leads to mate-in-one: 45...Qxg2#.} 
Nf3+ 
{Another check, another forced move. Black keeps his attack strong by without retaining the initiative.} 
46.Rxf3 
{Absolutely the ONLY legal move.} 
Bxf3+ 
{Black recaptures. White has now lost the exchange by giving up a Rook for a without Knight. White is now in check as well.} 
47.Kf1 
{Again, White plays the only legal move.} 
Qg2+ 
{By checking your opponent, you're in effect getting two moves in a row. While without he's busy trying to get out of check, you can pursue your own plans. Here without Black gives check and attacks the c2-pawn.} 
48.Ke1 
{Again, the White King goes to the only available square.} 
Qxc2 
{The Black Queen snaps up the free pawn.} 
49.Qxa6 
{White takes the opportunity to grab a free pawn, too. White is behind by the without exchange and the Black pieces are in the midst of the White position. In without fact, the Black Rooks haven't even joined the attack yet! Things look bad without for White.} 
) 
42...Qg4+ 
{Checking your opponent is like getting a free move. You take away his freedom without of action while you improve your position. Now Janowski is forced to find a without way out of check, while Lasker can just proceed with his plans.} 
44.Ng3 
{Now the point of 43...Nxe4 becomes clear. The centralized Knight dives into without the Kingside and blocks the check.} 
Nf5 
{The Black Knight steps back and attacks the White Knight that impudently without blocked the check. How will White stop the attack now?} 
45.Rf3 
{The Rook advances to guard the g3-Knight. But after ...Bxf1, the f3-Rook without hangs (or does it?)...} 
Bxf1 
{Lasker forges ahead and snags the Rook, leaving the f3-Rook hanging...} 
46.Qxf1 
{...but only for a moment. Now Janowski is the exchange behind, but almost all without of his pieces are on the Kingside. Black's pieces are bearing down on the without White position. Can Janowski hold on?} 
Nxe3 
{Lasker's Knight swoops in, killing the Bishop and attacking the White Queen. without Notice how paths are slowly being opened on the e- and f-files for the Black without Rooks.} 
47.Nxe3 
{Janowski takes the offending Knight and attacks the Black Queen.} 
Qc8 
{Janowski has successfully fought off the attack of the Black pieces, so it's without time for Lasker to reorganize his forces. The Black Queen moves to c8 and without threatens the c2-pawn. But Lasker has a deeper plan in mind...} 
48.Qd3 
{Rather than move the Queen to a square on the second rank (where its freedom without of movement would be restricted by the other White pieces), Janowski brings without it to d3 to defend the c2-pawn.} 
Qc5 
{Lasker continues to improve his position. He centralizes his Queen and pins without the White Knight on e3.} 
49.Qd2 
{Janowski pulls back his Queen, but wouldn't 49.Ne4 (attacking the Black without Queen) have been better? Then 50.Ng5 threatens mate-in-one!} 
d5 
{Lasker sees the possible White Knight move, so he prevents it (the pawn without guards e4 now).} 
50.Kg2 
{Janowski decides that it's high time he broke the pin on his Knight, so he without removes his King from the deadly a7-g1 diagonal. Lasker had hoped to break without in by 50...d4 51.Ng4 d3+, creating all sorts of havoc for White.} 
d4 
{He plays it anyway! Now the White Knight must move, but without the White without King on g1 51...d3 loses its zing. What's Lasker up to now?} 
51.Ng4 
{The White Knight gets out of danger. The reason Janowski places it on g4 without instead of f1 should be obvious: on f1, the Knight's mobility is absolutely without NIL! It would have no spaces to move to!} 
Bd6 
{Lasker continues to put pressure on the White forces. Here, the inactive without Bishop moves to a better post and attacks the White g4-pawn (which is now without attacked twice and defended twice). Should a defender move, the pawn is without lost.} 
52.Nf2 
{The White Knight continues to caper around the board, searching for a good without post. The square d3 (where it would blockade the Black d-pawn and attack the without Queen) looks good, or maybe e4 (where it closes off the e-file to Black)...} 
Qd5 
{The Black Queen prevents 53.Ne4 (if White plays that move, he'll lose a minor without piece) and pins the White Rook to the King.} 
53.c4 
{Janowski decides to sacrifice a pawn in order to obtain more space for his without pieces. He wants to draw the Black Queen off of d5 so that he can post a without Knight on e4 and attack the d6-Bishop.} 
Qxc4 
{Lasker accepts the offered pawn...} 
54.Nge4 
{...and a Knight jumps to e4. Now the d6-Bishop is in danger. What should without Lasker do?} 
Qd5 
{The course Lasker chooses is probably the simplest: the Queen returns to d5, without where it defends the menaced Bishop.} 
55.Nxd6 
{Even though he's behind in material, Janowski trades a Knight for the Black without Bishop. Eliminating the Bishop will slightly ease the pressure on the White without Kingside. There's even a (slight) chance of White Queenside counterplay.} 
Qxd6 
{The Queen recaptures and Black retains his material advantage.} 
56.Nd3 
{Janowski blockades the dangerous d-pawn with his Knight. The Knight also without helps to guard the f4-pawn and is more centrally placed to react to without emergencies on both sides of the board.} 
Qd5 
{Lasker pushes his Queen forward one square and re-establishes the pin on the without White Rook.} 
57.Kg3 
{Janowski again advances his King to break a pin. Now the Rook is freed up for without action (and since the f4-pawn is overprotected, the White Rook, Knight, without King, or Queen are free to move and aren't tied to the pawn's defense).} 
Rf6 
{Lasker increases his position's flexibility. Now he can double his Rooks on without the f-file, shift the f6-Rook to the h-file to attack the White h-pawn, or without move it to the g-file to check the White King.} 
58.Kf2 
{Janowski sees how deadly 58...Rg6+ 59.Ke2 Qh5 would be for him (the two heavy without Black pieces would soon smash through and force checkmate), so he saves his without neck by retreating his King.} 
Rh6 
{Lasker slides the Rook to the h-file and attacks the hanging h2-pawn. } 
59.h3 
{Janowski advances the pawn to h3, where it is protected by his Rook. See the without variation to find out why 59.Kg3 doesn't work (this will also clarify the without commentary to White's last move).} 
( 59.Kg3 
{The White position in the actual game is hanging by a thread. One false move without (like 59.Kg3) and it's curtains for White.} 
Qh5 
{Two of Black's heavy pieces on the h-file spell almost certain doom for without White.} 
60.Ne5 
{This repositioning of the Knight will allow it to jump to g4 to block a without g-file check. It also closes the e-file to the Black e8-Rook. Unfortunately without for White, Black has a check that White can't prevent...} 
Qh4+ 
{...so he plays it! Of course, the King has only one way to get out of without check...} 
61.Kg2 
{...by moving to g2. Obviously the Black Queen will now check the King again.} 
Qxh2+ 
{The Queen checks, eliminates a pawn, and skewers the White Queen!! The game without is essentially over, but we'll sadistically watch a few more moves...} 
62.Kf1 
{The White King has no choice. This is the only way to avoid check.} 
Qxd2 
{The Black Queen assassinates her counterpart.} 
63.Rg3

{Lasker toys with White like a cat with a mouse. He increases his hold on without White by defending his e3-Rook.}

h5

1.e4 
{Maroczy (White) starts with 1.e4, which will probably lead to an open without position.} 
Nf6 
{Lasker (Black) counters with Alekhine's Defense, in which he develops a piece without and immediately counterattacks the White e-pawn.} 
2.Nc3 
{Rather than advance the pawn to e5 (and attack the Knight), Maroczy prefers without to continue his development. Now the c3-Knight defends the e-pawn.} 
d5 
{Lasker hits the pawn again...} 
3.e5 
{...so Maroczy chooses to now advance and counterattack.} 
Nfd7 
{Lasker preserves his Knight by retreating to d7.} 
4.d4 
{Maroczy blocks any further advance of the Black d-pawn.} 
e6 
{Now the opening has transposed into a French Defense (usually reached by 1.e4 without e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 -- the Advance Variation). Since the center pawns are without locked, this will probably be a game of maneuver.} 
5.Nce2 
{Maroczy sees the possibility of a pin on his c-Knight (after ...Bb4). So he without withdraws the Knight to prevent the pin. He's blocked in his light-square without Bishop, though, so maybe this isn't such a good move.} 
c5 
{Lasker puts pressure on White's d-pawn. He can also develop his Queen to the without Queenside via b6 or a5.} 
6.c3 
{Maroczy reinforces his d-pawn and prevents checks along the a5-e1 diagonal.} 
Nc6 
{Lasker develops another minor piece and keeps putting pressure on the White without d-pawn.} 
7.f4 
{Maroczy begins to expand on the Kingside. Unfortunately, he's also blocked without his dark-square Bishop. What in the world is he up to?} 
Be7 
{Lasker develops yet another piece (he now enjoys a 3-1 lead in piece without development) and prepares to castle on the Kingside.} 
8.Nf3 
{Maroczy develops his other Knight. Perhaps playing f2-f4 first was an attempt without to prevent the f-pawn from being blocked by this Knight.} 
O-O 
{Lasker gets his King out of the center.} 
9.g3 
{Maroczy's play is unusual. He props up his f-pawn and has created a double without pawn chain, with e5 as the head of both. Very pretty, but is this good without chess?} 
cxd4 
{Lasker breaks one of White's pawn strings.} 
10.cxd4 
{Maroczy recaptures. Fortunately, the d-pawn is overprotected by the Queen and without both Knights.} 
Nb6 
{Lasker would like to get his light-squared Bishop off of the back rank, but without the Knight on d7 was in the way.} 
11.Bh3 
{More curious development from Maroczy. Both his light-square Bishop and without f3-Knight are unsupported. What's he up to? Maybe he's planning to advance without the f-pawn to f5.} 
Bd7 
{As we anticipated, Lasker moves his Bishop off of the back rank.} 
12.O-O 
{The King gets out of the center, but notice how the advanced Kingside pawns without create a "drafty" haven for the White King.} 
Rc8 
{Lasker's Rook grabs the open c-file.} 
13.g4 
{Now this is really strange...perhaps Maroczy is trying to prevent either without ...f5 or ...h5 by Black. In any event, he's blocked in his light-square without Bishop!} 
f6 
{Lasker begins to crack open the White position. If 14...fxe5 15.dxe5, Black without gets a passed d-pawn. If 14...fxe5 15.fxe5, Black may be able to use the without open f-file to attack White's King. So...} 
14.exf6 
{...Maroczy really has no choice but to capture.} 
Bxf6 
{Now Lasker has half-opened the f-file and has isolated White's d-pawn (which without may become a target for the Black forces).} 
15.g5 
{What Maroczy has going for him is that his pieces control a bunch of squares without on Black's side of the board. He increases that control by advancing the without pawn and attacking the Bishop.} 
Be7 
{Lasker makes the only move that doesn't lose material.} 
16.Kh1 
{Maroczy anticipates the b6-Knight taking up a post on c4, allowing the Black without Queen to come to b6. He doesn't like the thought of the Black Queen and without White King on the same diagonal, so he sidesteps the King.} 
Nc4 
{Black's Knight takes up an outpost on c4. Now, if White lets his guard down without and forgets to defend e3, the Knight could leap to e3 and fork the White without Queen and f1-Rook!} 
17.Nc3 
{Maroczy begins to untangle his pieces. By moving this Knight, he clears e2 without for his Queen. (He also has a trick up his sleeve -- but will Lasker fall without for it?)} 
Bb4 
{Lasker is looking ahead to possibly trading off his dark-square Bishop for without the c3-Knight, ensuring that his Knight will always have a safe outpost on without c4.} 
18.Qe2 
{Maroczy continues setting up his trap. Will Lasker see it in time?} 
Re8 
{Lasker defends the threatened e-pawn.} 
19.Qd3 
{Maroczy's plan continues, but it requires getting his Queen off of the same without file as Black's e8-Rook. What could he be plotting?} 
Nd6 
{The Knight prepares to take up a new post at f5. It also (indirectly) defends without the e-pawn (from f4-f5).} 
20.f5 
{Maroczy makes the pawn advance anyway (preparing this advance was another without reason for 19.Qd3).} 
Nxf5 
{Lasker gets his Knight outpost on f5, but do you see why this may not be so without good?} 
21.Nxd5 
{POW! Maroczy springs his trap. Do you see why 21...exd5 is impossible? without Because it would leave the f5-Knight defended just once against two without attackers. He's evened up the material and isolated the Black e-pawn.} 
Bd6 
{Lasker's dark-square Bishop was attacked by the White d5-Knight, so it has to without retreat.} 
22.Bxf5 
{Maroczy can't allow Black to maintain a Knight outpost on f5, so he captures without the Knight.} 
exf5 
{Unfortunately for White, this allows Lasker to recapture with the e-pawn. Now without Black isn't stuck with an isolated e-pawn anymore.} 
23.Nf4 
{The White King's position is looking a little bare, so Maroczy shifts the without Knight toward the Kingside to help in the defense.} 
Re4 
{Lasker begins to create problems for White. Now the White Knight on f4 is without attacked twice and only defended once.} 
24.Qb3+ 
{Maroczy buys some time with a check.} 
Kh8 
{24...Be6 (to block the check) doesn't work because of 25.Nxe6. So Lasker without moves the King out of check.} 
25.Nh4 
{By moving this Knight, Maroczy allows the f1-Rook to help defend the without f4-Knight.} 
Nxd4 
{Of course, the d-pawn was left up for grabs, so the Knight captures it and without attacks the White Queen.} 
26.Qh3 
{Using the open third rank, the Queen shifts rapidly to the Kingside and without prepares to join in the attack on the Black King.} 
Rc2 
{Lasker posts one of his Rooks on the seventh rank, where it will have a without disruptive effect on White's maneuverability.} 
27.g6 
{Maroczy's assault continues. He puts pressure on the Black King's fortress. without After 28.Nxf5, 29.Qxh7 will be mate!} 
Bc6 
{Of course, Lasker can't play 27...hxg6, because of 28.Nxg6+ (DOUBLE CHECK!) without Kg8 29.Qh8+ Kf7 30.Qxd8, and White has won the Black Queen! Instead, he without prepares a discovered check (once the e4-Rook moves).} 
28.Nf3 
{Playing 28.Nxf5 allows Black some counterthreats (once he prevents the Qxh7 without mate, of course), so Maroczy thinks it's best to block the a8-h1 diagonal. without Now he threatens mate-in-one!} 
h6 
{Advancing the pawn is Black's best way of stopping mate here. How will White without renew the attack?} 
29.Ne6 
{The Knight leaps forward to attack the Queen. But doesn't that allow without 29...Nxe6? Is there another purpose to this move?} 
Nxe6 
{Lasker does the expected and captures the Knight.} 
30.Bxh6 
{The hidden purpose of 29.Ne6 becomes clear. Maroczy was clearing the c1-h6 without diagonal for his dark-square Bishop to capture the h-pawn. 30...gxh6 would without be a serious mistake. What will Lasker do?} 
Rh4 
{Lasker double-attacks the White Queen and Bishop! Maroczy looks ahead into without the position (see the variation) and tips his King over. Lasker has won!} 
( 29...Rh4 
{In this variation we'll see why Maroczy resigned.} 
31.Rf2 
{If the White Queen abandons the h-file, it's curtains for White. The best bet without is to stop one of the Black Rook attacks.} 
Rxf2 
{Of course, it was only a temporary measure. Black is in no hurry to capture without the Queen; as noted earlier, the Queen isn't going anywhere.} 
32.Kg1 
{The King gets out of the corner and attacks the Black Rook.} 
Rxh3 
{Black decides that the time is right to grab the Queen.} 
33.Kxf2 
{The King captures the second Rook, but no matter -- Black is already way without ahead in material. With both Bishops aiming at the Kingside, plus a Queen in without reserve, Black will have no trouble winning this game.}

1.d4 
{Capablanca (White) opens with 1.d4, a move that usually leads to closed, without positional games.} 
e6 
{Alekhine (Black) surprises us by not disputing White's intention to set up a without central pawn pair on d4 and e4.} 
2.e4 
{Capa achieves in two moves the ideal central pawn setup for White. } 
d5 
{NOW Alekhine disputes the pawn pair! What started as a d-pawn opening has without been transformed into the French Defense, an e-pawn opening better suited to without Alekhine's open style. The French usually begins 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5.} 
3.Nc3 
{Capa's Knight develops off of the first rank and defends the endangered without e-pawn.} 
Nf6 
{Alekhine piles up on the White e-pawn, developing usefully as he does so.} 
4.Bg5 
{Rather than put another piece's protection on the e-pawn, Capa defends it by without pinning one of its attackers! (He's continuing his development at the same without time).} 
Bb4 
{Alekhine knocks out the White e-pawn's support by pinning the defending without piece.} 
5.exd5 
{Capablanca decides it's better to trade off the e-pawn rather than to without continue trying to defend it.} 
Qxd5 
{Surprise! Alekhine brings the Queen out early (usually a bad idea!) and without recaptures on d5. Notice that the c3-Knight can't take the Queen because without it's pinned, and that the f6-Knight is no longer pinned.} 
6.Bxf6 
{The d-pawn's inability to advance tells Capa that his pawns will probably be without posted on dark squares and that his dark-squared Bishop will become bad. He without trades it for a Black Knight. } 
Bxc3+ 
{Instead of immediately playing 6...gxf6 (which would hand the initiative over without to White), Alekhine keeps the initiative by interposing another move: a without capture WITH CHECK.} 
7.bxc3 
{Capa is forced to expend a tempo to get out of check. He makes the most without sensible reply. He's now saddled with doubled pawns, but he also has a without half-open b-file for his Rooks.} 
gxf6 
{Now Alekhine captures the Bishop. He, too, now has a set of doubled pawns, without but the half-open g-file offers some compensation.} 
8.Qd2 
{The reason that Capa plays this may seem obscure, but he prevents Black from without fianchettoing his c8-Bishop. If 7...b6, then 8.Be2 threatens to skewer the without Black Queen and Rook by 9.Bf3.} 
Nd7 
{The Knight devlops off of the first rank and intends to wind up on the hole without on c4 by way of b6.} 
9.c4 
{Capa assaults the centrally-placed Queen.} 
Qe4+ 
{Rather than retreating to d6 (and cramping Black's position), the Queen without advances with check.} 
10.Ne2 
{Capa develops another piece usefully while he blocks check.} 
Nb6 
{Alekhine continues with his Knight maneuver. Next stop: c4 (unless White without prevents it).} 
11.f3 
{Capa kicks the Queen out of the center. Once the Black Queen moves away, the without pin on his Knight will be released.} 
Qc6 
{By pulling the Queen back to c6, Alekhine attacks the c4-pawn twice. The pawn without is totally undefended. How can Capa save it? } 
12.c5 
{Capa defends the pawn by advancing it! The pawn now counterattacks the Black without Knight on b6. } 
Nd5 
{The Black Knight could easily be knocked off of c4 by White's Queen and without Bishop, so Alekhine decides to shift it over toward the sparsely-defended without Kingside.} 
13.c4 
{Capa decides to prod the Knight a little to hasten its departure from the without center. } 
Ne7 
{The Black Knight abandons the center, backing up to a new post where it can without shift to the Kingside at a moment's notice. Now both players have to find a without way to effectively develop their Bishops.} 
14.Nc3 
{Capa accomplishes two objectives with this move: 1) He sets up the move Ne4, without which threatens the Black f6-pawn; 2) he allows his Bishop to develop off of without the first rank. } 
f5 
{Alekhine doesn't plan to wait for White to play Ne4. He advances his f-pawn without and denies the Knight access to e4. But Black is now incredibly weak on the without Kingside dark squares (since no pawns guard these squares). } 
15.Be2 
{If the Bishop advances to d3, its mobility is limited by the pawns on c4 and without f5. On e2, the Bishop will at least have access to the Kingside after the without White f3-pawn advances.} 
Rg8 
{Alekhine takes control of the half-open g-file and attacks the without g2-pawn. } 
16.O-O 
{Capa castles. In addition to the usual benefits of castling, the White King without now defends the (pinned!) g2-pawn. } 
Bd7 
{Alekhine finally gets his Bishop off of the first rank. Notice, though, that without White has a big lead in development, as Black's Rooks are not yet connected.} 
17.Qe3 
{The White Queen comes to e3 to allow Capa to push the d-pawn (otherwise the without pawn push would leave the c5-pawn hanging!). Now if White plays d4-d5, the without Queen will protect the c5-pawn.} 
b6 
{Things are getting a little dicey for the Black Queen, which has very limited without mobility. Alekhine advances a pawn to give the Queen an "escape hatch" on b7 without should White get frisky and lauch an attack in the center. } 
18.Rfd1 
{It looks as though Capa DOES plan an attack on the center files. The Rook on without d1 helps to support a d-pawn advance and prevents the loss of a pawn after without 18...bxc5 19.d5 exd5 20.cxd5 Qd6.} 
bxc5 
{With each move, White improves his position a little more. Alekhine can do without very little to improve his, so he decides to undertake some offensive without action, throwing White off guard and delaying any more White without improvements. } 
19.d5 
{Allowing 19...cxd4 just loses a pawn for White, so Capa pushes the pawn and without attacks the Black Queen. He anticipates 19...exd5, which will allow him to without regain the pawn that Black took on the last move.} 
Qd6 
{19...exd5 20.cxd5 leaves Black with a White pawn stuck in his throat, so he without plans to make the swap on e6 instead...} 
20.dxe6 
{Capa grabs back his lost pawn and sets up two attacks: Rxd6 and exd7. Of without course, Black can simply sidestep both attacks... } 
Qxe6 
{...which he does. Black remains a pawn ahead (offset somewhat by his TWO sets without of doubled pawns). The White Queen's presence increases the weakness of without these pawns, so Alekhine offers an exchange of Queens.} 
21.Qxc5 
{Capablanca will have none of it. He's more interested in regaining his lost without pawn. The material balance is even once again.} 
Qb6 
{The Black Queen pins its White conterpart and siezes the open b-file. Now without White is powerless to prevent a Queen exchange if Alekhine desires without it. } 
22.Qf2 
{Other than 22.Qxb6, this is the only move for the White Queen that doesn't without lose material.} 
f4 
{The White Bishop will be stronger if it can become mobile. Alekhine blocks without the mobilizing advance of the White f-pawn. The problem is that the Black without f-pawn is undefended.} 
23.Rab1 
{Capablanca is undistracted by the juicy pawn, ripe for the picking. He goes without after the Black Queen instead. } 
Qxf2+ 
{Alekhine decides that it's time to trade off the Queens.} 
24.Kxf2 
{The only sensible response for White is to take back.} 
Bc6

Nh4 
{Alekhine makes his own threat: if Rxf4, then ...Nxg2! The White King would be without unable to take the Knight (because of the g8-Rook's without protection!). } 
27.Bf1 
{Capa stops the Black threat of ...Nxg2 by protecting the endangered pawn with without his Bishop. } 
Ng6 
{Alekhine, who's no fool, slides the Knight back to again protect his f4-pawn.} 
28.Ne2 
{Capa hits the f4-pawn again. It's impossible for Alekhine to defend it a without second time, so the pawn is lost. } 
Ke7 
{Alekhine abandons his pawn and advances the King. Now the Black Rooks are without finally connected!} 
29.Re1 
{What's this? Capa doesn't take the pawn right away. He sets up a discovered without check instead... } 
Rgb8 
{Since White's Rook abandoned the b-file, the Black Rook grabs control of it. without Alekhine hopes to be able to get an attack going along the without b-file. } 
30.Nxf4+ 
{Capa grabs the pawn, checks Black (with the e1-Rook), and sets up 31.Nxg6 without (since he's a pawn ahead, Capa wants to trade down and head for the without endgame). } 
Kf8 
{Since 29...Rgb8 made sure that his Rooks would stay connected, it's better without for the Black King to return to the first rank than run to the board's without center and get mated there.} 
31.Nxg6+ 
{Capa's one-pawn advantage ought to be enough to win, so he starts swapping without off pieces to get to the endgame. This move also allows him to control the without initiative (since Black must now get out of check). } 
hxg6 
{Alekhine has the choice of which pawn to recapture with, so he follows the without principle "Capture towards the center".} 
32.Bd3 
{Capa shifts his Bishop to a better post. He's probably thinking of moving his without Bishop to e4 to trade it for Black's Bishop. } 
Rb2+ 
{Alekhine begins his counterattack on the b-file, getting his Rook to the without seventh rank and attacking White's King and a2-pawn. } 
33.Re2 
{Capa simply blocks the check and attacks the Black Rook. This also prevents without Black from regaining his lost pawn with 33...Rxa2.} 
Rab8 
{Alekhine defends his menaced Rook.} 
34.Be4 
{The White Bishop attacks its undefended Black counterpart.} 
Rxe2+ 
{Taking the Rook with check gives Alekhine the initiative and will allow him without to stop a White Rook counter-invasion on the seventh rank. Watch...} 
35.Kxe2 
{Forced. Otherwise Capa loses his material advantage.} 
Bxe4 
{NOW Alekhine trades Bishops.} 
36.fxe4 
{Again forced. Alekhine still has the initiative. What will he do?} 
Ke7 
{Alekhine prevents White from playing 37.Rd7 by covering that square with his without King. } 
37.Rd2 
{Capa makes his own covering move. Now 37...Rb2, attacking the a2-pawn, is without impossible. What now for Black?} 
Ke6 
{Centralizing your King is important in the endgame. If you ever get stuck without trying to come up with a plan, playing by the general chess principles is without usually a good idea.} 
38.Ke3 
{Now that the players have reached the endgame, each will try to promote their without pawns. The forces will jockey for position and each player will try to without outmaneuver the other. Capa begins centralizing his King.} 
c6 
{Alekhine gets his pawn a step closer to promotion and prevents the White Rook without from moving to d5.} 
39.h4 
{Capa gets his Kingside pawns rolling.} 
Rh8 
{Alekhine attacks the boldly-advancing h-pawn...} 
40.g3 
{...so Capablanca defends it. If White could move twice in a row, he'd without probably play c4-c5 here, controlling d5 and d6 with pawns, allowing the without White Rook to move while still cutting the Black King off from the d-file.} 
Rh5 
{Alekhine's Rook is well-placed here, preventing White from advancing his without c-pawn. The Rook also has rapid access to the Queenside.} 
41.Rh2 
{Capa prepares 42.g4 (impossible before, because of ...Rxh4).} 
Ra5 
{Here's that "rapid access to the Queenside"! Alekhine can now play ...Ra3+ without (skewering the King and winning the g3-pawn) or Ra4 (attacking the c4-pawn). without The threat against the a2-pawn also keeps the White Rook on the same rank.} 
42.Kf4 
{Capa prevents the ...Ra3+ skewer. Notice how Capa is being kept busy reacting without to Black's threats.} 
f6 
{Alekhine continues to improve his position by inching his pawn forward.} 
43.Rc2 
{Capa backs up his c-pawn, intending to play c4-c5, cutting the Black Rook off without from most of the board.} 
Re5 
{The Black Rook slides back to the center before White can slam the gate shut without with c4-c5.} 
44.c5

Rh5 
{Preventing the g-pawn's advance (45.g4 Rxh4).} 
45.Rc3 
{Capa increases his own Rook's mobility. Possible now is 46.Ra3 Rxc5 47.Rxa7 without (where Capa remains a pawn ahead).} 
a5 
{Now 46.Ra3 doesn't work for White (46.Ra3 Rxc5, the Black a-pawn is without protected, and the material is even).} 
46.Rc2 
{It's hard to say what Capa is thinking here. Perhaps the Rook will return to without the h-file to prepare the advance of the g-pawn. Or maybe Capa is just without making a waiting move...} 
Re5 
{Alekhine is thinking of starting a Kingside pawn advance, but doesn't want to without block the ...Rxc5 threat. On e5, the Rook is guarded by the King, allowing without the f6-pawn to move.}

Rh5 
{Alekhine hustles the Rook back to a half-open file where it can respond to a without White invasion of the position.} 
48.Kf3 
{Capa has few options here: his Kingside pawns can't advance and his Rook is without restricted to the c-file (tied to the defense of the c5-pawn). He makes a without non-committal King move.} 
Ke7 
{The King backs up, allowing Alekhine to play f6-f5 without the complications without following e4xf5+ (the net result of these complications being that Black without would be stuck defending an isolated f-pawn).} 
49.Kg4 
{The White King heads for h3, where it can support the h-pawn, allowing the without g-pawn to advance.}

53.Kf4 
{The King slides over next to the e-pawn, offering to protect it.} 
Kg8 
{Alekhine's King has to stay on the f- and g-files to prevent the White Rook without from attacking the Black pawns.} 
54.Ra7 
{Capa turns his attentions toward the Black a-pawn. Now the Black Rook is tied without to the a-pawn's defense. He also prepares Ra6 (which attacks TWO Black without pawns).}

Kg8 
{Alekhine has come back from a pawn down to even up the game. He'll be content without with a draw here. He decides to let Capa do the heavy mental work of without devising a plan.} 
56.g4 
{Capa reveals his plan: he finally begins his Kingside pawn advance.} 
g5+ 
{Alekhine counters with a pawn advance of his own. It will be hard for White without to realize any advantage here.} 
57.hxg5 
{Capa must either advance the h-pawn or capture Black's g-pawn (he can't allow without 57.gxh4, which puts Black a pawn ahead and gives Black a passed pawn).} 
Rxg5 
{By recapturing with the Rook, Alekhine ensures that the material stays even. without Now his c6-pawn's path is unobstructed by the Rook as well.} 
58.Ra6 
{Capa menaces ALL THREE Black pawns with this move! } 
Rc5 
{The only way to hold the fort. If 58...c5, then 59.Rxf6 leaves Black a pawn without behind.} 
59.Ke3 
{Capa decides to shake things up a bit. The White King is heading for d4, without where it attacks the Black Rook.} 
Kf7 
{Since the White Rook isn't about to give up its post on a6, Alekhine sees without that it's safe for his King to advance toward the center and guard the without f-pawn.} 
60.Kd4 
{The White King drives the Black Rook from c5. Now it's impossible for the without Rook to defend both of his menaced pawns -- one of them must fall.} 
Rg5 
{If one Black pawn must fall, then it's only logical for Black to retaliate by without attacking a White pawn (which cannot now be defended).} 
61.Rxc6 
{Obviously! Capa couldn't take the a5-pawn!} 
Rxg4 
{An eye for an eye... Now the e4-pawn is pinned!} 
62.Rc5 
{Capa prevents Black from winning a pawn with f6-f5, and attacks the Black without a-pawn at the same time.} 
Rg5 
{Alekhine offers to exchange Rooks (and since the position is dead even, without offers Capablanca a draw). The World Champion accepts, and the game ends.}

1.e4 
{Bogoljubow (White) makes a bid for center control and opens lines for the without development of his pieces.} 
e6 
{White's plan in the opening is to establish pawns on d4 and e4; Black's plan without is to prevent this. How does Reti's move do this. Watch...} 
2.d4 
{Bogo has achieved his aim of getting two central pawns on d4 and e4. Now he without will develop his forces around the pawn duo in an effort to keep them there.} 
d5 
{Now we see the point of 1.e6: the e-pawn supports the d5-pawn. This is the without French Defense (see the last game -- Capablanca-Alekhine), in which Black without pushes the d-pawn and challenges White's center.} 
3.Nc3 
{Since the e4-pawn is under attack, Bogo must find a way to defend it. 3.exd5 without is possible, but leads to drawish positions. Bogo instead develops a Knight without to protect the pawn.} 
Nf6 
{Reti, who took grabbed the initiative with his second move, keeps it by without hitting at the White e-pawn a second time. } 
4.Bg5 
{Rather than guarding the pawn directly, Bogo defends it indirectly by pinning without one of its attackers (and develops another piece as well!). } 
Bb4 
{Reti pins one of the White e-pawn's defenders (and clears the deck for without castling, too). Now the e-pawn is attacked once and is without undefended! } 
5.Nge2 
{Bogo decides to give up the e4-pawn. He develops the other Knight. Now, after without ...Bxc3, he can reply Nxc3, threatening Nxe4 (after the pawns are exchanged, without of course).} 
dxe4 
{Reti is finally able to kill the White e-pawn, wrecking White's ideal d4-e4 without pawn pair.} 
6.a3 
{Bogo attacks the pinning Black Bishop, forcing Black to make up his mind without whether to take the c3-Knight or retreat the Bishop. This is called "putting without the question to the Bishop".} 
Be7 
{Reti releases the pin on White's c3-Knight and breaks the pin on his without f6-Knight at the same time.}

Bxf6 
{Recapturing with the Bishop is much better than recapturing with the g-pawn. without Now the Bishop is posted on the long a1-h8 diagonal.}

{...giving itself up in the process! White still has a space advantage; his without pieces cover ten squares on Black's half of the board compared to Black's without control of three squares on White's half (more on this after the game).}

{Bogo just keeps on grabbing space. He intends to advance his Kingside pawns without and storm the ramparts in front of the Black King.} 
Be7 
{In games where the players castle on opposite wings, they tend to attack on without opposite wings (it makes sense to attack the enemy where his King is, without right?). The Black attack will be on the Queenside. Now the Bishop can join without in.} 
16.g4 
{Bogo continues preparing an attack by grabbing still more space on the without Kingside.}

Qb6 
{It's "move it or lose it" for Reti! The square b6 is less restrictive to the without Queen's mobility than a6, so the Queen moves here. Notice that the White without forces have an enormous space advantage.}

19.dxc5 
{Bogo recaptures, threatens the Black Queen, and establishes a pawn chain from without a3 to c5. The c5-pawn is particularly annoying to Black, putting a big cramp without in his game. }

{Here's something unique: Black, forced by White to retreat his Queen, turns without the tables by retreating to a square where the Queen attacks the without h1-Rook! } 
20.Bd3 
{Bogo's Bishop gets off of the first rank, allowing the d1-Rook to defend its without brother. Now the development of the White army is complete. } 
a5 
{Reti moves to break up the White Queenside pawn chain. 21.bxa5 Rxa5 is very without bad for White, while allowing 21...axb4 22.axb4 Ra1+ is unacceptable as without well. What will White do?} 
21.Qe4 
{Bogo decides to trade Queens, figuring that his space advantage and control without of the initiative will see him through to victory.} 
Qxe4 
{Reti decides to swap Queens since White's advantages aren't overwhelming without ones.} 
22.Bxe4 
{Bogo completes the transaction, maintaining control of the initiatve by without threatening the Black Rook on a8.}

{Instead of trading Rooks, Bogo decides to strengthen his Queenside pawn without structure by adding another pawn to the complex.} 
axb4

24.axb4 
{Bogo reasons that a base pawn on c3 will be easier to defend than one on a3 without (since c3 is closer to the center). This pawn structure may be uglier, but without it should be more defensible.} 
f5 
{The Black pawn advances (under the Rook's protection) to create a little without havoc on the Kingside.} 
25.gxf5 
{Bogo decides that trading is a good idea. If Black replies 25...exf5 to without attack the White Bishop, the f-file is blocked to the f8-Rook, and White without just plays 26.Bc6 (attacking the b5-pawn).} 
e5 
{Reti declines to recapture and block his f-Rook's access to the file. He without reasons that this is just a temporary sacrifice; he can always pick up one without of the White f-pawns later to even the score.} 
26.h5

28.Bc6 
{Bogo attacks the b5-pawn (which he'll win; Black can't defend it with without 28...Rb8 because of 29.Rd7+, which drops the c-pawn. Either way, a Black without pawn must fall!). } 
Kf6 
{Reti continues to inch his King forward.} 
29.Bxb5 
{A Black pawn bites the dust. Now Reti is behind by two pawns...} 
Kxf5 
{...but not for long! Now he's behind by one pawn (the one he sacrificed on without the f-file). If the Black King moves off of the f-file, it will uncover an without attack by the f8-Rook on the f2-pawn.} 
30.Bc6 
{Bogo is well-aware of the possibility of a discovered attack on his f-pawn, without so he prepares for this eventuality with this Bishop move. Watch...}

Be7 
{There's nothing really constructive for Black to do here, so Reti's Bishop without backs up to a square where it covers both Rooks.} 
32.Ra1 
{Bogo lets Reti have the open d-file; he's going to invade the Black position without along the open a-file.} 
Bg5 
{Reti is nobody's fool; he sees that Bogo intends to play 33.Ra7 to attack the without c7-pawn. The Bishop clears the second rank to allow for the pawn's defense. without Look...} 
33.Ra7 
{Bogo plays the anticipated move... } 
Rf7

34.Be4 
{The White Bishop takes up a beautiful central post, controls two diagonals without (b1-h7 & a8-h1), blockades the e5-pawn, keeps the Black King off of d5 and without f5, and attacks the h7-pawn! }

1.e4 
{This is probably the most flexible opening move. It establishes center without control and allows for the easy development of two of White's pieces.} 
e5 
{The same ideas are achieved by Black.} 
2.f4 
{Tartakower again plays the King's Gambit (the same opening he used in Round without One). This was the most popular opening throughout the late 1800's. White without gambits his f-pawn to achieve speedy development for his pieces.} 
exf4 
{Yates gives up his control of the center, but he's now ahead by a pawn.} 
3.Be2 
{This is an old variation of the King's Gambit that Tartakower has obviously without analyzed extensively. Now he can play 3.Nf3 and if Black replies 3...Qh4+, without the White King will just sidestep to f1.} 
Nc6 
{The standard move here is 3...d5, giving back the gambit pawn and contesting without White's domination of the center. Does Yates have a better idea, or is he without just unfamiliar with this varaition? Time will tell...} 
4.d4 
{Tartakower's aggressive little pawns dominate the center, controlling c5-f5. without The dark-square Bishop takes aim at Black's advanced f4-pawn, without too. } 
d5 
{Yates contests White's center control and opens up a path for the development without of his light-square Bishop.} 
5.exd5 
{"Why not?" thinks Tartakower as he captures the pawn and attacks the Knight without on c6. "If Yates recaptures with his Queen, I can just chase it away by without advancing my b1-Knight."} 
Qxd5 
{Yates does recapture with his Queen and retains his one-pawn advantage in without material. But now White enjoys a 1-0 pawn advantage on the center two files.} 
6.Nf3 
{Tartakower protects his g2-pawn from the Black Queen's attack by interposing without his Knight. He's also managed to defend his d4-pawn (which before now was without attacked twice but only defended once).} 
Bg4 
{Yates prepares to knock out one of the d-pawn's defenders. After ...Bxf3, he without can safely capture the d-pawn and hold a two pawn material advantage.} 
7.Nc3 
{Tartakower forestalls the Black attack by counterattacking, developing a without piece with a threat (the c3-Knight threatens the Black Queen).} 
Bb4 
{Yates creatively nips White's counterthreat in the bud by pinning the White without c3-Knight to the King!} 
8.O-O 
{Tartakower, thinking clearly, simply castles. This develops the Rook, brings without the King to safety, and ends the pin on the c3-Knight (which again attacks without the Black Queen!).} 
Bxc3 
{Yates trades his Bishop for the Knight. This saves his threatened Queen and without forces White to double his pawns on the c-file.} 
9.bxc3 
{Tartakower must recapture, of course. Now he has doubled c-pawns and an without isolated a-pawn. His Queenside pawn structure is pretty weak.} 
Nge7 
{To capture the d-pawn, Yates must first trade his remaining Bishop for the without f3-Knight, leaving him with two Knights against the White Bishop pair. Yates without decides that the second pawn isn't worth it and develops a Knight instead.} 
10.Bxf4 
{Tartakower wins his pawn back and evens up the material.} 
Qe4 
{Yates' Queen advance threatens the White f4-Bishop. } 
11.Bxc7 
{Instead of retreating the Bishop, Tartakower aggressively captures the Black without c7-pawn! The tables have turned: now it's Tartakower who's ahead by a pawn! without (Of course, Yates saw this coming; it's a deliberate sacrifice).} 
O-O 
{Yates has sacrificed a pawn; he has a space advantage and pressure against without the White position in return for it. As White has no immediate threats that without must be dealt with, Yates takes the time to castle the King into a safe without corner.} 
12.Qd2 
{This Queen advance gains space for White: he's in total control of f4. Now he without can safely retreat his c7-Bishop there, or even offer an exchange of Queens without (after first guarding the e2-Bishop by moving a Rook to e1). } 
Nd5 
{Yates fights White for control of f4 and attacks the c7-Bishop at the same without time. You can plainly see how a centralized Knight controls a lot of space without and can perform multiple functions at once! } 
13.Bg3 
{The threatened Bishop withdraws. It could also have retreated to e5, but without after 13...Nxe5 14.dxe5 White would have been saddled with an isolated without e-pawn.} 
Qe3+ 
{Yates decides to ram his minor pieces down White's throat. He begins by without offering a Queen trade. If White declines the trade, Black wins back his without pawn by ...Nxc3.} 
14.Qxe3 
{Of course, Tartakower makes the swap (and retains his one-pawn advantage in without the process).} 
Nxe3 
{Yates recaptures with his Knight, which now threatens the f1-Rook and the without pawn on c2. If you want to make your opponent uncomfortable, posting a without Knight on your sixth rank (especially on a center file) is a great way to do without it! } 
15.Rfc1 
{Not much of a Knight fork! Tartakower saves both pieces by moving one to without protect the other. No matter -- the Black Knight sticks like a bone in without White's throat, and Black still holds the initiative.} 
Rfe8 
{The f-Rook shifts over one file to back up the advanced Black Knight.} 
16.Bd3 
{Tartakower slowly begins to wriggle his pieces free. By moving his Bishop off without of the d1-h5 file, he releases the pin on his Knight.} 
Nd5 
{Since this Knight wasn't threatening any White pieces and wasn't really without cramping White's mobility, Yates decides to pull the Knight back to attack without the c3-pawn. (But maybe he should have done this on his last without move!) } 
17.c4 
{You can often defend a pawn by simply advancing it! That's exactly what without Tartakower does here. He defends the pawn and turns the tables by attacking without the attacker!} 
Bxf3 
{Time out for a brief intermission: over on the Kingside, Yates trades his without last Bishop for White's Knight. This gives White the advantage of the Bishop without pair, which is somewhat offset by his horrible pawn structure.} 
18.gxf3 
{Of course, Tartakower must recapture the Bishop. He now has the Bishop pair without and an extra pawn, but his own pawn structure is in tatters. } 
Nc3 
{Yates doesn't retreat the Knight. Instead, he prevents White's Rooks from without seizing the half-open b-file. Now White has another small crisis: the without d4-pawn is under attack from the c6-Knight. } 
19.d5 
{If it worked once, it'll work again! The menaced pawn advances, turning the without tables on its attacker.} 
Nd4 
{The Knight still occupies d4 (albeit without winning a pawn). Now another without White pawn is under attack! The f3-pawn is attacked by the Knight that's without newly-posted on d4.} 
20.Kg2 
{The only way to save the pawn is to advance the King to protect it. The without square g2 is better than f2 for this purpose because on g2 the King doesn't without interfere with the mobility of the g3-Bishop. } 
Nde2 
{The Black Knight swoops in with another fork, this time attacking the c1-Rook without and the g3-Bishop. Now he'll eliminate White's advantage of the Bishop without pair. } 
21.Re1 
{Obviously, Tartakower saves the more valuable of the two menaced pieces. He without also looks ahead to a Rook trade on the e-file. The best way for Tartakower without to convert his one-pawn advanatge is to trade pieces and head for the without endgame.} 
Nxg3 
{As anticipated, Yates kills one of White's Bishops. Now he'll have a fairly without well-placed Knight against a bad Bishop for White. However, White's pawns without are farther advanced than Black's (which still rest on their home squares).} 
22.Rxe8+ 
{Surprise! Tartakower decides to force the exchange of Rooks before without recapturing the Knight (if 22.hxg3, Black could refuse to simplify and move without the e8-Rook away). The check on the Black King forces him to swap off a pair without of Rooks.} 
Rxe8 
{Yates plays the only move possible.} 
23.hxg3 
{And Tartakower makes the obvious reply. Taking stock, we see that White is a without pawn ahead and has a bad Bishop. Black has a Knight sticking in the heart of without White's position and command of the e-file, but his pawns haven't budged!} 
Na4 
{Yates begins the repositioning of his Knight. Its immediate destination is c5 without where it can attack White's Bishop. A more significant reason for this move without is that White threatened 24.a4, which would trap the Knight! } 
24.Kf2 
{The White King slides over one square to prevent a Rook invasion along the without e-file. The squares e1, e2, and e3 are all denied to the Black Rook due to without the influence of White's King. } 
g6 
{Yates gives his King an "escape hatch" on g7 to prevent an embittering "back without rank" mate from White's Rook sometime in the future. Now that the chance of without a "cheapo" mate is gone, White must work for the win!} 
25.Rb1 
{Tartakower attacks the b7-pawn. 25.Re1 was another possibility, but not a without good idea. It will be easier to force the win with a Rook and Bishop than without with the Bishop alone (due to the White's terrible pawn without structure). } 
b6 
{Yates defends the pawn by advancing it. Now its brother pawn on a7 protects without it. Black now threatens to play ...Nc3, running the White Rook off of the without b-file. How should White proceed from here?} 
26.Rb4 
{The Rook charges ahead and attacks the Knight before the Knight has a chance without to attack the Rook! } 
Nc5 
{The Black Knight retreats to its protected outpost on c5, where it assails without the White Bishop. However, due to his one-pawn deficit, it's really not in without Yates' best interest to trade down by capturing the Bishop. } 
27.a4 
{Tartakower proceeds methodically. He plans 28.a5. After 28...bxa5, he can without play 29.Rb5 and fork the Black Knight and a5-pawn. If Black waits for without 29.axb6, then 29...axb6 30.Rxb6.} 
Kf8 
{Yates begins to bring his king over to the Queenside to aid in the defense. without Why didn't he play 27...Nb7 to prevent White from pushing his a-pawn? See without the variation to find out.} 
( 26...Nb7 
{In this variation by Alekhine, we'll see why 27.Nb7 is a BAD idea for Black.} 
28.a5 
{Surprisingly (unless you can see far enough ahead), White pushes his a-pawn without anyway!} 
Nxa5 
{The Black Knight captures it to even up the material, and everything seems without all right for Black. But is it really...?} 
29.c5 
{White advances his c-pawn and attacks the Black Knight's support pawn.} 
bxc5 
{Black has no choice but to take the White pawn. So what's the big deal? If without White plays 30.Rb5, Black pushes the c-pawn and counterattacks the Bishop. without White and Black swap evenly, minor piece for minor piece, right?} 
30.Rb5 
{White bravely forges ahead with the Rook and forks the Black Knight and without pawn. } 
c4 
{Black proceeds with his own planned counterattack, trading his Knight for the without White Bishop... } 
31.Be2 
{HAAAA! The Bishop nimbly escapes, but the Black Knight can't get away!! All without of the squares that it can move to are covered by White's forces!! The without Knight is trapped and will be captured on White's next without move!! } 
) 
28.a5 
{Tartakower pushes ahead with his Queenside assault. The b6-pawn is attacked without twice and defended just once...} 
Rb8 
{...so to save the pawn, Yates must put another defender on it. Yates is without beginning to sweat as he wonders "What happened?!? I was doing so well just without a few moves ago!"} 
29.Ke3 
{Since the Black Rook no longer has its "force field" set up along the e-file, without the White King can now cross the file to get over to where the action is. without Remember, centralize your King in the endgame!} 
Ke7 
{Maybe Yates read our minds! He, too, begins to bring his King over toward the without center and Queenside. But Tartakower has a one-square jump on him (his King without is a square closer to the center than Yates' is).} 
30.Kd4 
{Tartakower's King continues his drive into the center, the ideal place for without the King in the endgame.} 
Kd6 
{Yates gets his King as close to the center as he can. Now neither King can without advance toward the other (remember the "invisible force field"? See the without entry on "Opposition" in the Glossary).} 
31.Rb1 
{Tartakower continues to conduct the endgame with precision. He pulls back his without Rook to the first rank. From here it has easy access to any file on the without board.} 
Rb7 
{The Rook advances to a square where it can be protected by the Knight. This without makes it possible for Yates to play ...bxa5 and safely win a pawn.} 
32.axb6 
{Tartakower heads Yates off at the pass. Instead of losing a pawn, White makes without an even trade.} 
axb6 
{Yates completes the transaction. As pieces and pawns come off the board, without White gets closer to a win. Remember, though, that White's c2-pawn is without blocked behind the c4-pawn and is consequently very weak (so White has just without a slight edge). } 
33.Ra1 
{Tartakower's Rook grabs the open a-file. Now the Rook can range along both without the a-file and first rank. } 
Re7 
{Yates slides his Rook over to command the e-file. Its range is limited without though, because it can be captured on any square on the file except for e7 without and e8! The Black pieces' mobility is practically without nil! } 
34.g4 
{Since his Kingside pawns are safe from the Black Rook, Tarakower decides that without now would be a good time to expand. He starts advancing his Kingside pawns.} 
f6 
{Yates prevents White from playing 35.g5 (which would, in one stroke, prevent without any of the Black Kingside pawns from advancing). In addition, e5 is now safe without for the Black Rook (White can't play Kxe5 because of the f6-pawn).}

Rb7 
{Yates slides his Rook back over to the b-file and protects the pawn...}

{At this time (1924), the most popular opening move for White. It grabs space without in the center and gives the Queen and light-square Bishop an outlet for without development. } 
e5 
{If the King's pawn push is a good opening move for White, it's equally good without for Black, and for the same reasons. } 
2.f4 
{This is the King's Gambit, an opening that was extremely popular in the 19th without Century. In this opening, White offers to gambit a pawn to lure Black's without e-pawn onto a flank file (the f-file), thus weakening Black's center.} 
exf4 
{Bogo accepts the gambit pawn. Now he's a pawn ahead, but his center is weak, without and the advanced f4-pawn may become hard to defend.} 
3.Be2 
{Tartakower plays an unusual move here. 3.Bc4 is normal, but White doesn't without like the looks of 3...d5.  3.Bd3 is bad because it blocks White's d-pawn. So without White prefers to develop the Bishop here. } 
d5 
{Bogo offers to return the gambit pawn. If White plays 4.exd5, Black can play without ...Nf6 without having to worry about the possible reply e4-e5.} 
4.exd5 
{Tartakower accepts the pawn offer. Now Bogo can play 4...Qxd5 and stay a pawn without ahead, but White's reply 5.Nc3 (threatening the Queen) would make Black without waste a tempo retreating the Queen. So... } 
Nf6 
{...Bogo develops his Knight (now that it's safe to do so, since White no without longer has a pawn on the e-file) and attacks the d5-pawn as without well. } 
5.c4 
{Tartakower props up his pawn. This has the added benefit of giving his Queen without some scope along the a4-d1 diagonal. } 
c6 
{Black hits the pawn a second time, threatening to grab the c4-pawn as well without (6...cxd5 7.cxd5 Nxd5). } 
6.d4 
{Tartakower anticipates an exchange of pawns in the center. By advancing his without d-pawn, he insures that he'll have at least one pawn in the center, without controlling space on Black's half of the board.} 
cxd5 
{Bogo begins an exchange in which he expects to post his Knight on the without important center square d5, after 7.cxd5 (i.e. 7.cxd5 Nxd5).} 
7.Bxf4 
{Tartakower takes the other pawn instead. This makes the material even and without gives White an edge in development (White has more pieces and pawns off of without their starting squares than Black does).} 
dxc4 
{Bogo forges ahead and grabs White's c-pawn before White has a chance to play without c4-c5. If Black had allowed the White c-pawn to advance, it would have given without White a 3-2 pawn majority on the Queenside.} 
8.Bxc4 
{The White Bishop recaptures and makes the material even. White has a big lead without in development, but the downside is that his King is awfully exposed. The without King's Gambit often leads to double-edged positions like this.} 
Bb4+ 
{Black has to develop this Bishop sooner or later, so why not develop it with without a check? } 
9.Nc3 
{The White Knight develops off of the back rank and blocks the check.} 
O-O 
{Bogo gets his exposed King out of the drafty center. Now his Rook can take without over the open e-file.} 
10.Nge2 
{Tartakower gets his other Knight out with three purposes: to block the without threatened Rook check at e8, to protect the c3-Knight (in the event of without ...Bxc3+), and to clear the way for castling.} 
Bg4 
{Bogo ties Tartakower up in knots. This developing Bishop move pins the without e2-Knight to the White Queen. } 
11.O-O 
{The King gets out of the center, which ends the pin by the b4-Bishop. Notice without how White's Rook on f1 commands the half-open f-file. } 
Nbd7 
{Bogo develops his last minor piece. He looks ahead to a future Nd7-b6, without attacking White's Bishop on c4. } 
12.Qb3 
{Tartakower gets his Queen out of the danger zone (away from the threatening without g4-Bishop) and attacks the other Black Bishop on b4. } 
Bxc3 
{Black takes the Knight and leaves White an interesting problem: recapture without with the Queen or Knight (which leaves the d-pawn isolated) or recapture without with the b-pawn (isolating the a-pawn and giving White three pawn islands)?} 
13.bxc3 
{Tartakower recaptures with the b-pawn. Now his d-pawn is supported by another without pawn, and his Queen attacks the Black pawn on b7. But White now has three without pawn islands and his a-pawn is isolated and may become a target without later. } 
Nb6 
{The Knight blocks the White Queen's attack and menaces the White Bishop on without c4.} 
14.Bd3 
{White has the advantage of having both of his Bishops, an advantage that he without wants to keep. So the light-squared Bishop backs off. } 
Nfd5 
{Black's aggressive Knights continue to threaten White's Bishops! Also, see without what a good center square the Knight occupies. From d5, it influences eight without squares (the best a Knight can do!). } 
15.Bd2 
{Again, Tartakower wants to hold on to the advantage of having both of his without Bishops (to see why, refer to the Glossary entry entitled "Two Bishops/Two without Knights"). So White retreats the dark-squared Bishop.} 
Bxe2 
{Bogo gives up his other Bishop to kill off White's only Knight. What Black without has achieved is the weakening of White's c3-pawn (since White's Knight was without defending it). Now that the Knight is gone, the c3-pawn will become a without target. } 
16.Bxe2 
{The Black Bishop comes off the board and goes back into the box. Now White without has two Bishops against two Knights, a big advantage on an open board. How without should Black proceed?} 
Rc8 
{Bogo attempts to tie up White's Queenside forces by attacking the weakened without c3-pawn. Since the pawn is now attacked twice (by Black's d5-Knight and without Rook), White's Queen and d2-Bishop are tied to its without defense. } 
17.Rf3 
{The Rook advances and defends the pawn. White could also have defended the without pawn by advancing it to c4, but this move carries a whole new set of without problems with it (see the variation). } 
( 17.c4 
{Let's examine the idea of defending the c-pawn by advancing it. (Variation by without Alekhine)} 
Nf6 
{Of course, Black must retreat the threatened Knight. This uncovers an attack without by the Black Queen against the White d4-pawn. } 
18.d5 
{White defends this pawn by advancing it also.} 
Ne4 
{The Black Knight dives in and attacks the d2-Bishop. } 
19.Bb4 
{The threatened Bishop has to move, so it goes to a square where it attacks without Black's f8-Rook. } 
Re8 
{The Rook goes to an open file where it will attack the e2-Bishop (after the without e4-Knight moves). White is back in the same boat as before, with the c4-pawn without attacked twice and defended twice, and now Black has other threats as without well! } 
) 
16...Qc7 
{The Black pieces continue to pile up on White's c-pawn. Now the Black Queen without gets into the act. } 
18.Raf1 
{Tartakower comes up with his own threat. He doubles his Rooks on the f-file, without creating a battery that puts pressure on Black's f7-pawn. } 
f6 
{Why does Bogo advance the pawn and create a pin on his own d5-Knight (from without the White Queen)? He plans to move his own Queen and doesn't think too much without of White's Queen and both Rooks bearing down on f7. } 
19.Bd3 
{How can the Bishop move here and block the f3-Rook's defense of the c3-pawn? without Because the d5-Knight is pinned and can't attack the pawn! The well-placed without Bishop on d3 controls two diagonals (a6-f1 and b1-h7) as without well. } 
Nc4 
{In spite of the fact that Knights are usually inferior to Bishops on an open without board, Bogo is making the most of what he has. If the Knight is allowed to without capture the e2-Bishop, it will then fork White's Queen and both without Rooks! } 
20.Rh3 
{Surprise! Tartakower hits Black with an ugly threat that must be immediately without dealt with, giving Black no time to capture the e2-Bishop and fork all three without of White's heavy pieces! (See the variation to Black's next without move). } 
g6 
{Bogo advances this pawn to block the White d3-Bishop's attack on the h7-pawn. without But now Black's Kingside pawns are very weak (especially the one on f6).} 
( 19...Nxd2 
{Here's why Bogo can't take the d2-Bishop...it leads to a forced without mate! } 
21.Bxh7+ 
{The White Bishop grabs the pawn with impunity (the King can't capture the without Bishop, which is protected by the h3-Rook!) } 
Kf7 
{Obviously the King must flee, and f7 is the only square.} 
22.Qxd5+ 
{The Queen grabs the Knight and checks again! } 
Ke8 
{Moving the King is again the only escape (and it doesn't matter if the King without goes to e7 or e8, as we'll soon see).} 
23.Re1+ 
{White checks yet again! } 
Qe5 
{Black is forced to block check with the Queen, because the King can't move without and blocking with the Knight just loses both the Knight and Queen.} 
24.Rxe5+ 
{Even if this variation wasn't a forced mate, White's material advantage is without now so overwhelming that he should win anyway. } 
fxe5 
{Absolutely the only move for Black.} 
25.Qe6+ 
{Another check! The walls are closing in on the Black King! } 
Kd8 
{Again, Black has just a single move to get out of check.} 
26.Qd6+ 
{The Queen checks again, driving Black's King to the fatal square. } 
Ke8 
{I guarantee you that the King won't move again!} 
27.Bg6+ 
{Another check! Black has only a single move to block check! } 
Rf7 
{The only move Black has. But now it's curtains for him. Do you see the without winning move?} 
28.Rh8#  
{And that's all she wrote for Black!} 
) 
21.Re1 
{Rooks belong on open (or half-open) files. Tartakower siezes control of the without e-file. } 
Nxd2 
{Bogo takes away some of White's advantage by capturing one of White's strong without Bishops. Now that White's dark-square Bishop is gone, this makes White without slightly weaker on the dark squares.} 
22.Qxd5+ 
{Tartakower keeps the material even by capturing the Black Knight with without check. } 
Qf7 
{Bogo blocks the check and offers to exchange Queens...} 
23.Qxf7+ 
{...an offer which Tartakower accepts.} 
Rxf7 
{Bogo completes the exchange of Queens. But now his Knight is alone, without undefended deep inside enemy territory!} 
24.Re2 
{Of course, Tartakower attacks Black's main weakness (his Knight), driving it without back. } 
Nc4 
{The Knight retreats to the safe haven of the c4-square, where it's protected without by the Rook on c8. } 
25.Re8+ 
{The crowd is stunned! Many spectators gasp audibly, and many more exchange without silent surprised glances, as if to say "Doesn't this lose the White Rook?!".} 
Rxe8 
{Bogo, seeing more than we do, heaves a great sorrowful sigh and captures the without Rook.} 
26.Bxc4 
{Tartakower grabs the Knight and pins the f7-Rook! He used a tactic called without "deflection" to lure the Rook off of the c-file, so that he could take the without Knight and pin (and win!) the f7-Rook. He deflected the Black Rook away from without the protection of the c4-Knight, allowing the Bishop to capture it and pin without the f7-Rook. } 
h5 
{Bogo is in no hurry to move his King (since the f7-Rook is lost whether the without Black King moves now or later). Instead, he advances his h-pawn, to take without space away from White's h3-Rook.} 
27.Kf2 
{The White King advances to prevent the e8-Rook from invading the White without position by moving to e2. In your games, look for moves like this that take without squares away from your opponent. } 
Rc8 
{The Rook attacks White's Bishop. Bogo is trying to prod Tartakower into without resolving the pinned-Rook situation.} 
28.Bxf7+ 
{Tartakower obliges by removing the Rook from the board.} 
Kxf7 
{Of course, Bogo had to recapture or be behind by a piece. Look at the board. without The material is dead even. Black has a 3-2 Kingside pawn majority while without White enjoys a 3-2 advantage on the Queenside. } 
29.Re3 
{The Rook siezes the open e-file, cuts down the Black King's mobility, and without continues to defend the threatened c3-pawn. } 
b5 
{The Black b-pawn grabs space and prevents White's a-pawn from advancing to without a4.} 
30.Ke2 
{From looking at where each side's pawn majority is, we know that White should without attack on the Queenside. The White King heads for the Queenside, to help without support the attack.} 
Rc6 
{Bogo would seem to be contemplating his chances of getting a draw after without exchanging Rooks (31...Re6 32.Rxe6 Kxe6).} 
31.Kd3 
{The White King comes to d3 to protect the c3-pawn. This frees up White's without Rook, letting it perform other useful tasks. } 
h4 
{Black's pawns continue to storm the Kingside. Bogo intends to play ...g6-g5, without forming a pawn chain and allowing his King to penetrate White's Kingside via without the light squares (if neccessary). } 
32.Re2 
{Tartakower's Rook, now free to maneuver, pulls back to the second rank, where without  it can move quickly to either the Kingside or Queenside as needed.} 
g5 
{Bogo completes the pawn-chain. Now, if he advances the King to g6 (protecting without f5), he could push the f-pawn to f5 and continue the pawn without assault. } 
33.Rb2 
{Since there's no immediate threat from Black on the Kingside, Tartakower without makes his own threatening move, menacing the b5-pawn.} 
Rb6 
{Protecting the pawn by a7-a6 cuts the Black Rook off from the a-file. Bogo without prefers to keep lines open for his Rook, so he defends the b-pawn with his without Rook.} 
34.d5 
{Tartakower advances his passed-pawn, intending to support it by advancing his without  King.} 
Ke7 
{The Black King shifts toward the d-file, intending to head off and blockade without the White d-pawn.} 
35.Kd4 
{The White King moves ahead to support the advanced passed d-pawn.} 
g4 
{Now that he seems to have neutralized White's passed-pawn advance, Black without continues his Kingside pawnstorm.} 
36.Kc5 
{White has a three-part plan in mind: 1) to win the Black b-pawn by exchanging without Rooks on b5; 2) to advance his own c-pawn to c4 to protect the d-pawn; 3) to without capture the Black a-pawn with his King.} 
Rb8 
{Black has his own threat in mind: to move his Rook to c8 where it will check without the White King. After the White King moves away, the Rook will capture the without White pawn on c3. } 
37.Kd4 
{White has to abandon his original plan and come up with a new one: advance without the c-pawn to c4, as the Black b-pawn can't recapture due to Rxb8. Then without White will push the pawn to c5, and have two dangerous connected passed without pawns.} 
Rb6 
{Bogo pushes the Rook back, nipping Tartakower's plan in the bud. Now if White without pushes with 38.c3-c4, Black's b-pawn can capture, as the Black Rook is now without protected by the a7-pawn.} 
38.h3 
{Tartakower has to come up with his third plan in three moves! Now he plans to without trade off a pair of pawns to defuse the potentially dangerous Kingside without pawnstorm.} 
g3 
{Now both sides' g- and h-pawns are locked, but Black has an ace in the hole: without his f-pawn! It can still advance and break the blockage, which will give without Black a passed pawn on either the f- or g-files.} 
39.a3 
{Tartakower prepares to play Rb2-b4. After the White King moves, the Rook on without b4 will menace the Black h-pawn. } 
Kd7 
{Bogo gets his King in front of White's passed pawn.} 
40.Kc5 
{Tartakower is considering advancing the d-pawn to d6 to cut down the Black without Rook's mobility. Also, with the King off of the 4th rank, White can play without Rb2-b4 and threaten the Black h-pawn. } 
Rb8 
{The Black Rook backs off to a square from which it can easily shift to the without Kingside, if necessary.} 
41.Rb4 
{Trading Rooks (starting with 41.Rxb5) is bad for White (see variation), so without Tartakower decides to threaten the Black h-pawn.} 
( 41.Rxb5 
{Here's why White's game collapses if he trades Rooks. White begins by taking without the Black b-pawn. (Variation by Alekhine).} 
Rxb5+ 
{Black, of course, responds by capturing the Rook.} 
42.Kxb5 
{The White King must recapture, or White will be behind by a Rook.} 
f5 
{The Black f-pawn advances, trying to promote to a Queen.} 
43.Kc4 
{The chase is on! The White King tries to catch Black's f-pawn.} 
f4 
{The pawn keeps pushing for the finish line.} 
44.Kd3 
{The King tries to head off the pawn. Who will win the race?!?} 
f3 
{Black wins! If the g2-pawn takes the Black f3-pawn, then the g3-pawn will without advance and promote. If, instead, the White King moves to e3, then the Black without f3-pawn captures the g2-pawn and still can't be stopped by the without King! } 
) 
40...f5 
{Black is not afraid of losing his h-pawn, because he can still keep the without material even (see the variation to White's next move).} 
42.a4 
{Now White plans to win Black's b-pawn. White will capture it with the a-pawn, without then advance his c-pawn to defend both the b5 and d5-pawns.} 
( 42.Rxh4 
{In this variation, we'll see what happens if White captures Black's h-pawn.} 
Rc8+ 
{Black checks, with a skewer (or x-ray attack) on the White without c3-pawn. } 
43.Kxb5 
{The White King gobbles up the Black pawn. Now White is two pawns ahead (but without this is only temporary, as we'll see).} 
Rxc3 
{Black's Rook grabs a pawn. Black is still down a pawn, but the Black Rook's without control of the c-file keeps the White King from coming to the rescue of the without d5-pawn. Black will soon win it (or the g2-pawn) and even up the without material. } 
) 
41...a6 
{Bogo defends the b-pawn with the a-pawn.} 
43.Kd4 
{The White King gets out of the way of the c-pawn, so that it can advance and without hit the b-pawn again.} 
Re8 
{Believe it or not, this move actually prevents White from capturing the without b-pawn! To see why, check out the variation to White's next move.} 
44.Kd3 
{The King backs up to allow the White Rook access to the Kingside. } 
( 44.axb5 
{Here we'll look at what happens if White immediately captures the b-pawn. without This variation was worked out by Alekhine after the round ended.} 
Re4+ 
{Instead of recapturing immediately (which leads to the loss of a pawn), Black without checks the White King.} 
45.Kd3 
{The King moves out of check.} 
Rxb4 
{Black decides to swap off the Rooks.} 
46.cxb4 
{Of course, White must recapture, or be behind by a Rook!} 
axb5 
{After this recapture, Black should be able to win the d-pawn (due to the laws without  of opposition) and then go on to win with his extra pawn.} 
) 
43...bxa4 
{Bogo swaps off a pawn! This sacrifice will allow his Rook to invade White's without position (as we'll soon see).} 
45.Rxa4 
{Of course, White takes the pawn!} 
Re1 
{Bogo charges in with his Rook. He hopes that White will take the a-pawn, without displacing the White Rook and allowing the Black Rook to grab the White without Kingside pawns.} 
46.Rxa6 
{White accepts the sacrificed pawn.} 
Rg1 
{The Black Rook threatens the White g2-pawn. But it seems that Bogo has without miscalculated...} 
47.Ra2 
{...because the defense of the pawn is simple for White to acheive! Now White without has two connected passed pawns (on the c & d files)!} 
Kd6 
{Bogo makes the only really constructive move: the Black King threatens the without White d-pawn.} 
48.c4 
{The c4-pawn protects its brother on the d-file. Now the White position has no without real weaknesses for Black to exploit.} 
Ke5 
{If the King advances to f4, the d-pawn advances unstoppably to promote to a without Queen. So what is Bogo doing? He's marking time, awaiting further without developments and praying for a draw by threefold repetition of position.} 
49.Re2+ 
{White checks with his Rook and drives the Black King back.} 
Kd6 
{The only move Black has that doesn't immediately lose the game.} 
50.Rc2 
{Now the Rook slips back to the Queenside to support the advance of the White without c-pawn. As a general rule, support the advance of your passed pawns by without putting your Rooks behind them on the same file. } 
Kc5 
{The Black King stops the c-pawn's advance and still denies the d6-square to without White's d-pawn.} 
51.Rd2 
{As the White King can't move ahead and support the d-pawn's advance (since without Black controls both d4 and e4), the White Rook shifts over to guard the without d-pawn (once the White King goes to c3 to guard the c-pawn).} 
Rf1 
{The Black Rook guards the advance of the f-pawn. Bogo hopes to create a without passed pawn on the f- or g-file. But notice how Black's Rook blocks the without advance of the f-pawn. That's why Rooks belong behind passed pawns, not in without front of them.} 
52.Ke2 
{A move with a dual purpose: the King attacks Black's Rook while the White without Rook now supports the d5-pawn's advance. } 
Rg1 
{The Rook comes back to g1 to threaten the g2-pawn again, forcing White's King without to move (so that the White Rook can defend the g2-pawn).} 
53.Ke3 
{The White King doesn't have to protect the c4-pawn, because if the Black King without captures the pawn, the d-pawn heads for d8 and promotion, outrunning the without Black King.} 
Kd6 
{Due to the lack of any really constructive moves in this position, Bogo marks without time by shifting his King.} 
54.c5+ 
{The pawn checks with impunity! If the Black King captures it, the d-pawn will without advance to become a new Queen, protected by the White Rook.} 
Kxc5 
{Bogo takes the pawn anyway! He counts on being able to get his Rook to his without first rank (White's eighth rank) in time to stop the d-pawn.} 
55.d6 
{Predictably, the pawn advances toward the promotion square.} 
Re1+ 
{Rather than trying to get his Rook back by ...Ra1 (which cuts things pretty without close), Bogo checks instead. This makes White waste a tempo getting his King without out of check, and will give the Black Rook access to e8.} 
56.Kf4 
{The White King is forced to the f-file. If it had moved to the d-file, it without would have blocked the d6-pawn's protection from the White Rook, allowing without the Black King to take the pawn.} 
Re8 
{The Black Rook gets back in plenty of time to block the d-pawn's promotion.} 
57.d7 
{The pawn steps ahead again, attacking the Rook and threatening promotion by without d7xe8 as well.} 
Rd8 
{Of course, the Rook blockades White's dangerous passed pawn. But now look at without the position of the White King. It sits among the Black pawns like a wolf without among a flock of sheep!} 
58.Kxf5 
{Black is finished. The White King will gobble up the immobile Black Pawns, without giving White two connected passed pawns. The Black Rook can't move and the without Black King can't cross the d-file! The pawns can't be defended! Bogo without resigns. }

1.e4 
{Lasker (White) advances his e-pawn. This is White's most aggressive opening without move. It grabs a healthy chunk of the center (the d5- and f5-squares) and without allows White free development of his Queen and light-square Bishop.} 
e5 
{Bogoljubow (Black) responds with an equally aggressive move of his own. He, without too, grabs a couple of center squares (d4 and f4), and opens lines for the without development of his Queen and dark-square Bishop.} 
2.Nf3 
{Lasker continues in an aggressive fashion. He develops his Kingside Knight without and attacks the Black d5-pawn at the same time.} 
d6 
{Most people play 2...Nc6 here in order to guard the e5-pawn. Instead, Bogo without opts to play Philidor's Defense (named after the greatest chessplayer of the without 18th Century), in which Black defends the pawn with 2...d6. } 
3.d4 
{Lasker's d-pawn charges ahead and attacks the Black e5-pawn a second time. without Notice, too, that the White dark-square Bishop is now free to without develop. } 
Nf6 
{Rather than try to defend the pawn again (see the variation), Bogo launches a without counterattack. The f6-Knight threatens the White e4-pawn. Will White capture without the Black e5-pawn or defend his own endangered pawn? } 
( 2...Nc6 
{In this variation, Black tries to defend his e5-pawn a second time.} 
4.d5 
{White advances his d-pawn and attacks the Black Knight! Now Black must move without it or lose it!} 
Nce7 
{The Knight retreats to e7. Now his position is horribly cramped. He'll have a without hard time developing his pieces since White controls so many of the squares without that Black needs (like c6, e6, and f5). } 
) 
4.Nc3 
{Lasker chooses to develop another piece and defend the e4-pawn at the same without time (doing two things with one move!). In your games, look for moves like without this that serve more than one purpose.} 
Nbd7 
{Since c6 is off limits for the Knight (because of White's reply d4-d5), Bogo without develops it to d7. The problem is that now the Knight blocks in the Bishop without on c8.} 
5.Bc4 
{Lasker clears the deck for Kingside castling by developing his light-square without Bishop. This Bishop helps to control d5 and puts pressure on Black's without vulnerable f7-square, adjacent to his King. } 
Be7 
{Bogo gets his Bishop off the back rank, paving the way for castling on the without Kingside. Notice how cramped the Black position is. Bogo lacks good squares without for his pieces.} 
6.O-O 
{The King heads for the safety of the flank, while the Rook develops toward without the center.} 
O-O 
{Black castles as well. The Rook on f8 helps ease the pressure on the f7-pawn. without But now the pawn is pinned by the White c4-Rook. Should the f6-Knight move, without the f7-pawn can't advance because of the pin. } 
7.Bg5 
{Lasker prepares to trade dark-square Bishops if the Black f6-Knight moves. without All of the White minor pieces are developed, while Black's c8-Bishop is without still at least two moves away from freedom.} 
c6 
{Bogo prepares a Queenside push. He plans to play b7-b5 in order to drive back without the White Bishop on c4, and then follow it up with b5-b4, driving away the without c3-Knight, the e4-pawn's only defender, making ...Nxe4 possible. } 
8.Bb3 
{Lasker sees the coming pawn push and pulls his Bishop back now. However, without a2-a4 would have prevented the Black pawn push b7-b5 just as easily, and without would have grabbed still more space for White. } 
h6 
{Bogo threatens the other White Bishop and forces Lasker to decide whether to without capture the f6-Knight now or waste a tempo by moving the Bishop again. This without is known as "putting the question to the Bishop".} 
9.Bh4 
{Lasker decides to spend the tempo necessary to move the Bishop. By coming without back to h4 the Bishop keeps the pressure on the Black f6-Knight.} 
Re8 
{Bogo gets ready for the opening of the e-file by sliding his Rook over. He'll without move his f6-Knight, and if White plays Bxe7, he can play ...Rxe7. Then Bogo without will play...Qe8 and ...exd4, then begin to pile up on White's e-pawn.} 
10.Qd3 
{Lasker, seeing that Bogoljubow is planning to free his game by opening up the without e-file, hits upon a plan to prevent it. The first step is to bring his Queen without to d3, where it has access to the a6-f1 diagonal. } 
Nh5 
{Bogo, unaware of Lasker's counterplan, proceeds with his own plan. He expects without Lasker to play Bxe7.} 
11.Qc4 
{Now Lasker threatens to win material by 12.Qxf7+ Kh8 13.Qxh5, getting a pawn without and Knight for free! } 
Rf8 
{This forces Bogo to bring his Rook back to f8 to defend the pawn. Now it's without White's move. His Bishop on h4 is threatened. Should Lasker exchange it for without the e7-Bishop, or retreat it to g3?} 
12.Bxe7 
{Of course, he exchanges it. If he had played Bg3, then Black could have without replied ...Nxg3, forcing White to double his pawns on the g-file (and without doubled pawns are weak, remember?).} 
Qxe7 
{Bogo has to re-capture or be behind in material. Now look at the board. without Because of the exchange of Bishops, Black's position is now less cramped. without How should White proceed?} 
13.Ne2 
{Lasker doesn't like the looks of Black's threatened ...Nf4 (establishing an without outpost in the heart of the White position). The e2-Knight covers f4 and without keeps the Black Knight from occupying it without threat of without capture. } 
a5 
{Bogo begins to expand on the Queenside. His obvious threat is a5-a4, winning without the b3-Bishop. Among his other threats is ...exd4, to be followed by ...Nc5 without (allowing him to pile up on the e4-pawn). } 
14.Qc3 
{Lasker doesn't play c2-c3 to give the Bishop an escape hatch. Instead, he without pulls back his Queen to let the Bishop escape to c4.} 
a4 
{At first glance, b7-b5 (to prepare to trap the Bishop via a5-a4) might look without tempting. Look closer -- you'll see that White's reply Qxc6 loses a pawn!} 
15.Bc4 
{The White Bishop makes good its escape!} 
b5 
{Now that the White Bishop blocks the White Queen from capturing Black's pawn without on c6, it's safe for Bogo to continue his Queenside pawn mobilization. He's without getting more room, little by little!} 
16.Bd3 
{The White Bishop finally retreats to a safe haven on d3. Of course, the poor without Bishop has no squares to move to. It's stuck like a fly in a block of amber! without Now it's Lasker who is finding his position cramped!} 
Bb7 
{Since White was threatening Qxc6, Bogo has to make a move to protect it. He without (finally!) develops his light-square Bishop. He can also later play c6-c5 to without get more room for his d7-Knight (...c5, then dxc5, Nxc5). } 
17.dxe5 
{Lasker decides to open the d-file for exploitation by his Rooks. He forces without the elimination of both d-pawns with this move.} 
dxe5 
{Obviously, Bogo recaptures with his d-pawn.} 
18.Rad1 
{The a1-Rook slides over to d1 where it would command the file except for that without problem d3-Bishop in its way. How will Lasker free the trapped Bishop?} 
Rfe8 
{Seeing that the e5-pawn is attacked twice and defended twice, Bogo decides to without overprotect the pawn. This will free up one of the three defending pieces without should one of them be required elsewhere.} 
19.Ng3 
{Lasker decides that the fastest way to free his trapped Bishop is to provide without it an outlet on e2. He clears this square by moving his Knight to g3. Of without course, Bogo can now make White double his pawns with ...Nxg3...} 
Nxg3 
{...which he does. Bogo didn't want the g3-Knight to jump to f5 and establish without an outpost there. Now Lasker is faced with the choice of which pawn to without recapture with.} 
20.hxg3 
{He chooses to recapture with the h-pawn. Taking back with the f-pawn would without leave him with TWO weaknesses: doubled g-pawns and an isolated e-pawn. These without would be somewhat offset by the open f-file for his Rook, though.} 
Nf6 
{Here's where Black's overprotection of the e5-pawn pays off. One of the without protecting pieces, the Knight, jumps to a better square and attacks the pawn without on e4, while the other two pieces stay behind to defend the e5-pawn. } 
21.Nh4 
{Like a bulldog with a bone, Lasker hangs on to the idea of posting a Knight without on f5. He shifts his remaining Knight to h4 and eyes up f5. } 
g6 
{Bogoljubow denies Lasker yet again. The g-pawn advances and prevents the without White Knight from occupying f5. } 
22.Qd2 
{Lasker brings his Queen back to menace the Black h6-pawn. Will Bogo now without protect the pawn by advancing it or by defending it with another without piece? } 
Kg7 
{Bogo decides to make the Black King earn its keep by putting it to work without defending the h-pawn.} 
23.Qe3 
{Lasker repositions his Queen, preparing to attack Black's Queenside by moving without to b6 later. } 
Ng4 
{Bogo attacks White's Queen. He secretly hopes that Lasker will proceed with without his plan to invade the Queenside by Qb6, because ...Ra6 will trap and win without the White Queen (see the variation to White's next move). } 
24.Qd2 
{Since the White Queen is prevented from moving to b6 (see the variation) and without is also attacked by the Black g4-Knight, Lasker has no choice but to retreat without the piece.} 
( 24.Qb6 
{Here's why White can't attack the Black Queenside with his Queen...} 
Ra6 
{The Rook advances and attacks the Queen, trapping it. The White Queen has no without square to retreat to (remember the Knight on g4?) and so is without lost. } 
) 
23...Qc5 
{Bogo sees that the White position is very cramped and understands that White without would like to play f2-f4 to get some more elbow room. The Black Queen on c5 without pins the f2-pawn to the White King and prevents the pawn's without advance. } 
25.Be2 
{The Black Knight sticks in the White position like a bone in Lasker's throat, without so he dislodges it by threatening it with the Bishop. } 
Nf6 
{The Black Knight is forced to abandon its advanced post, and retreats to the without only safe square available.} 
26.Bd3 
{Now Lasker is troubled by the possibility that one of the Black Rooks might without move to d8 and menace his Queen. His Bishop comes back to d3 to block that without threat.} 
Rad8 
{Bogo moves his a-Rook to the central d-file. Now there is every possibility without of the Black Knight returning to g4, because the White Bishop is now pinned without to the Queen and can't move to e2 again to kick the Knight back out.} 
27.Qe2 
{Since the White Bishop or f-pawn can't keep the Black Knight from reoccupying without g4, the White Queen is forced to come over and defend that square. This has without a further cramping effect on White, since the Queen no longer holds a5-e1.} 
Bc8 
{Bogo again demonstrates the advantages of having greater space and mobility. without His Bishop moves to c8, which springs a new threat: ...Bg4! which wins without either the White Queen or d1-Rook. } 
28.Kh1 
{Lasker is moves his King to h1 to dissolve the pin on the f-pawn. If Black without plays ...Bg4, Lasker can now reply f2-f3, saving both his Queen and d1-Rook. without .} 
Bg4 
{The Black Bishop predictably advances to g4 and attacks the White Queen, and without should the Queen move, the d1-Rook.} 
29.f3 
{Lasker saves the two threatened heavy pieces. (Qxg4 was impossible because of without ...Nxg4, and Nf3 lets Black advance his pawns). Now White has a bad Bishop, without an immobilized Knight, a weak g3-pawn, and restricted heavy pieces! What without next?} 
( 29.Nf3 
{White doesn't want to use his Knight to block the attack on his Queen, without because then White gives up his threat of Nh4-f5, which prevents the Black without g6-pawn from advancing...} 
g5 
{...like so. Since Black no longer had to worry about guarding against a White without Knight outpost on f5, his g-pawn can advance and restrict White's mobility without even further!} 
) 
28...Be6 
{The Black Bishop was attacked by the White f-pawn, so it had to move away. without Now it threatens White's a2-pawn! Bogo is smiling a little now. Why not? without Just look at White's position: the White pieces are all in each other's without way! } 
30.a3 
{Lasker sighs and advances the a-pawn. Pushing the b-pawn to b3 instead would without be bad for White because it would allow Black to pry open the Queenside without through pawn exchanges.} 
Re7 
{Bogoljubow prepares to double his Rooks on either the d- or e-files.} 
31.Rde1 
{It's a old chess saying: when you're cramped, free your game by exchanging without pieces. Lasker prepares to exchange Queens with this move. He plans to next without play Qe2-e3 or Qe2-f2, offering to swap Queens with Bogo.} 
Qd4 
{Bogo seems to like the idea of a trade, but he wants White to initiate it by without playing Qxd4. After exd4, Black will enjoy a 4-3 Queenside pawn majority without that he should be able to convert into a win. There's also a hidden point...} 
32.Qf2 
{Lasker feels that the exchange of Queens on f2 would be more to his advantage without than if it happens on e3, so his Queen comes to f2 to provoke a trade. But without there's a hidden point here, too...} 
Qxb2 
{Bogo's hidden point: he wins a pawn by not trading Queens. But remember that without Lasker had a hidden point as well...} 
33.Qc5 
{Lasker's hidden point: since Bogo didn't trade, the White Queen is suddenly without set loose on the Queenside! White now has a lot more maneuvering room. So without who fooled who? Did Lasker sacrifice the pawn on purpose? Hmmmm...} 
Rc7 
{Bogo has to defend the endangered c6-pawn. He could have protected it with without the other Rook (...Rd8-c8) but that would take a square away from his Bishop without and tend to cramp his game.} 
34.Rb1 
{Lasker shifts his Rook over to strike at the Black Queen.} 
Qd4 
{The Black Queen must retreat to d4, as it's the only square where it's without protected (by the e5 pawn).} 
35.Rxb5 
{The White Rook comes crashing in and wins back the pawn. If the Black c6-pawn without captures the Rook, White's Queen takes the Black Rook on c7 and the material without stays even (although the game becomes complex -- see the next variation).} 
g5 
{Bogo begins counter-measures on the Kingside. This pawn advance threatens the without White Knight. He could also have played ...cxb5 (see the variation).} 
( 34...cxb5 
{Let's examine what might have happened had Black decided to capture the Rook.} 
36.Qxc7 
{The White Queen captures the c7-Rook and the material stays even.} 
b4 
{Black advances his pawn in order to obtain a passed pawn on either the a- or without b-files.} 
37.axb4 
{White makes the capture on b4 and is now ahead by a pawn. Black now has a without passed a-pawn, while White has connected passed pawns on the b- and c-files. without The Black a-pawn is more dangerous due to its potential rapid advancement.} 
a3 
{Black proceeds to advance the pawn another step toward promotion, making it without still more dangerous to White.} 
38.Qa5 
{White's Queen comes back to a5 to threaten the Black a-pawn, while still without keeping an eye on the d8-Rook (if the Black Queen moves off of the d-file, without the Rook falls).} 
a2 
{The passed pawn advances to a square where the e6-Bishop protects it. Now the without a-pawn is just a step away from promotion.} 
39.b5 
{White feels that it's high time he came up with a threat of his own. He without begins the advance of his passed b-pawn. Notice that Black can't play a2-a1 without because the White Queen and Rook both defend that square, stopping the without pawn's advance.} 
Rb8 
{Now the White b-pawn can't advance either (because of the Black Queen and without Rook). Things are really knotted up now. Both players will have to do a lot without of maneuvering to press home an advantage. (Variation by Ed. Lasker)} 
) 
36.Nf5+ 
{The White Knight leaps to absolutely the ONLY square it had on the board! It without checks Black's King in the process, but it doesn't matter; the Knight is not without long for this world.} 
Bxf5 
{Bogo makes a questionable trade here: he's traded his good Bishop for White's without badly misplaced Knight. He'll win a pawn soon, but the price may have been without too high. We'll see...} 
37.exf5 
{The recapture must be made to keep an even material balance. Now White has without doubled f-pawns AND doubled g-pawns. OUCH!} 
Nh5 
{The Knight leaps ahead and attacks the g3-pawn, which can't be defended! If without White tries g3-g4, then ...Ng3+ forks the f1-Rook and the King! Kh2 looks without like a good try too, but that leads to checkmate (see the next variation)!} 
38.Re1 
{Bogoljubow is more clever than we gave him credit for. He's obviously without foreseen that White can't save the g3-pawn. In fact, all that Lasker can do without is move his Rook to prevent the hideous Knight fork after ...Nxg3+.}

{Bogo doesn't like the looks of 47...Kh7 (which leads to a forced mate for without White -- see the variation), so he decides to settle for the draw.} 
( 46...Kh7

48.f6+

Ne4+ 
{Black blocks check with the Knight (this is known as "interposing").}

{ The point here is to play Ng5 and set up an attack on the weak f7-pawn. } 
O-O 
{ In theory, White could still play Ng5 and trade his Knight and Bishop for Black's Rook and pawn. But the Bishop-Knight combination is a much more potent attacking force than a Rook and pawn, especially when there is a lot of material still on the board (due to the Knight's leaping ability).} 
5.O-O Nc6 6.Nd5

1.e4 
{Maroczy (White) decides to make the most of it by playing the attacking move without 1.e4.} 
e5 
{Marshall (Black) meets him head-on in the center.} 
2.Nf3 
{Maroczy continues his development and attacks Black's e-pawn.} 
Nf6 
{Rather than defending his pawn, Marshall counterattacks the White e-pawn. without This is the opening known as Petroff's Defense (sometimes called the Russian without Game).} 
3.Nc3 
{White usually plays 3.Nxe5 here. But Maroczy, ever defensive-minded, develops without his other Knight and defends his threatened e-pawn.} 
Bb4 
{Marshall keeps up the pressure by attacking the White e-pawn's defender. He's without also developed another Kingside piece.} 
4.d3 
{Maroczy insures that the e-pawn will remain defended, but in doing so has without placed his own c3-Knight into a pin!} 
d5 
{Marshall continues his central development and strikes again at the White without e-pawn.} 
5.exd5 
{Maroczy can't allow 5.d4 (winning the c3-Knight!), so he's forced to capture without Black's d-pawn.} 
Nxd5 
{Marshall recaptures and hits the c3-Knight a second time.} 
6.Bd2 
{By developing the Bishop to d2, Maroczy disolves the pin on his Knight.} 
O-O 
{6...Nxc3 7.bxc3 makes Black waste a tempo by moving the Bishop again, while without exchanging on c3 sarting with 6...Bxc3 gives up a valuable Bishop (that without Marshall would rather hang on to), so he castles instead.} 
7.Be2 
{Maroczy wants to castle Kingside, so he develops his last Kingside minor without piece to the only available square.} 
Nc6 
{If you don't see any immediate attacks or threats in the position, it's without almost always a good idea to continue your development.} 
8.O-O 
{Maroczy shuffles the King off to safety.} 
Be6 
{Marshall is now just a move away from connecting his Rooks and completing his without development.} 
9.Re1 
{Maroczy anticipates the eventual opening of the e-file and prepares by without posting his Rook there. If you're not sure of where to place your Rooks, the without d- and e- files are often good spots for them.} 
h6 
{Marshall prevents the annoying 10.Bg5 (which would threaten the Queen) and without gives his King an "escape hatch" to prevent back-rank disaster.} 
10.Nxd5 
{Relieve cramped positions by exchanging pieces! That's what Maroczy is trying without to do here.} 
Bxd2 
{Marshall can't allow 10...Bxd5 11.Bxb4 Nxb4 12.Nxe5 (which loses him a pawn) without so this move is virtually forced.} 
11.Nxd2 
{Maroczy naturally recaptures (or else it's 11...Bxe1 -- OUCH!).} 
Bxd5 
{And Marshall evens up the material balance.} 
12.Bf3 
{Maroczy aims for 12...Bxf3 13.Qxf3, gaining a tempo by trading his Bishop without which has moved only twice for Black's which would have moved three times by without capturing, plus White's Queen would be developed to boot!} 
Qd6 
{Marshall doesn't bite. Instead he connects his Rooks and completes his without development.} 
13.Ne4 
{Maroczy grabs the initiative by attacking the Black Queen.} 
Bxe4 
{Marshall hates to give an inch! Instead of retreating the Queen, he without eliminates the attacker.} 
14.Bxe4 
{Maroczy recaptures. Now his Bishop can operate on both sides of the board without from its central post.} 
Rae8 
{Marshall prepares to activate his Rook by playing Ra8-e8-e6-f6. This maneuver without is called a "Rook lift".} 
15.Bxc6 
{Maroczy further simplifies the position by getting the last minor pieces off without of the board.}

{Marshall recaptures with the Queen. 15...bxc6 would give him a terrible without Queenside pawn structure.} 
16.Qd2 
{Maroczy finally gets his Rooks connected.} 
Re6 
{Marshall continues the Rook lift. Now (since White no longer has a Bishop on without e4) he has the option to post the Rook on either f6 or g6.} 
17.Re3 
{Maroczy initiates his own Rook lift.} 
Rg6 
{The Rook goes to g6. Do you see Black's threat? He threatens 18...Qxg2#!} 
18.g3 
{Maroczy could have blocked with 18.Rg3, but 18...Rxg3 19.fxg3 (or hxg3) would without shatter his Kingside pawns. Advancing the g-pawn is the best bet.} 
f5 
{The f-pawn advances ominously. 19...f4 20.gxf4 exf4 (and White must retreat without the Rook). But can't White play 19.Rxe5 here?} 
19.Rxe5 
{White can, and does! Surely this wasn't an oversight on Marshall's part! He's without deliberately sacrificed the pawn. But why?} 
f4 
{The f-pawn continues to advance. Marshall's plan becomes clear. The kamikaze without pawn will break up the White Kingside pawn structure, opening lines for without Black's attack.} 
20.d4 
{Maroczy is unconcerned. He advances the d-pawn to a square where it props up without the Rook and can march ahaed to d5, attacking the Black Queen and blocking without its path to the White Kingside.} 
Qd7 
{The Queen shifts away from the oncoming pawn's attack.} 
21.Qd3 
{Maroczy keeps up the pressure by attacking the Black g6-Rook.} 
Rgf6 
{The Black Rook abandons its post and sets up a battery with its brother on without f8. Now, after fxg3, the Rooks will bear down on the White Kingside along without the f-file.} 
22.Rae1 
{Maroczy creates his own battery on the open e-file.} 
fxg3 
{Remember that by capturing with a pawn, you open up a file for your own without pieces. As expected, Marshall opens the f-file.} 
23.fxg3 
{Maroczy, of course, takes back.} 
Rf3 
{The Rook, supported by its brother, attacks the White Queen.} 
24.R5e3 
{White blocks the attack.} 
R3f7 
{Marshall withdraws, rather than give up the battery. Remember that exchanging without unnecessarily tends to blunt your attack. Exchanging here would make Black's without pawn sacrifice pointless.} 
25.c3 
{Maroczy strengthens the d-pawn.} 
Qd5 
{Marshall attacks the a2-pawn, hoping to cause it to advance prematurely without (which would weaken the White Queenside).} 
26.c4 
{Maroczy continues his expert defense by blocking Black's attack and without simultaneously attacking the Black Queen. The best defense is a good without offense!} 
Qd7 
{The Queen has no choice but to withdraw. The initiative passes back to White.} 
27.d5 
{Another strong move that serves both offensive and defensive purposes. The without d-pawn advances under the c-pawn's protection and siezes control of c6 and without e6, taking them away from Black.} 
Qd6 
{Marshall anticipates 28.b4, so he takes that square away from White.} 
28.Qd4 
{Maroczy counters by attacking a7.} 
Qg6 
{Marshall plans to invade White's second rank with moves like ...Qc2 and without ...Rf2.} 
29.Re6 
{Maroczy counterattacks by striking at Black's Queen.} 
Qc2 
{Marshall just slides his Queen down to c2 anyway. Phase 1 of his plan is without complete.} 
30.R6e2

b6 
{Marshall blocks the attack on his a-pawn...}

33.Rxf8+ 
{Maroczy exchanges Rooks on e8.} 
Rxf8 
{Marshall response is forced. Now some of the pressure has been relieved on without White's tender f2-square.} 
34.b3 
{Maroczy puts the last link into his a2-d5 pawn chain.} 
Qc2 
{Marshall again invades, and this time threatens the a2-pawn. Remember to without always attack an opponent's pawn chain at its base!} 
35.Qe2 
{Maroczy could have defended the pawn by advancing it to a4, but this would without weaken his Queenside pawns. He instead defends it by threatening the Black without Queen.} 
Qg6 
{Marshall feels that an exchange of Queens at this time would be to his without disadvantage, so he retreats the Queen instead.} 
36.Qe4 
{Maroczy continues to harass the Black Queen.} 
Qf6 
{Marshall still doesn't want to exchange. Instead, he attacks the sensitive without f2-square again. How will White defend it?} 
37.Qf4 
{The White Queen shuts Black off from f2 and again is offering an exchange of without Queens.} 
Qd8 
{The Black Queen retreats to a square where it defends the f8-Rook, uncovering without an attack on the White Queen.} 
38.Qe5 
{The White Queen must abandon the dangerous f-file. By going to the e-file, without Maroczy has once again set up a battery on the open file.} 
Qc8 
{Seeing that the White Queen was threatening the c7-pawn, Marshall shifts his without Queen to the pawn's defense.} 
39.Qe6 
{White again offers a Queen trade. The reason why he's so eager to eliminate without the Queens is that with his one-pawn advantage, he should easily be able to without win a Rook and pawn endgame.} 
Qa6 
{Marshall again refuses to exchange Queens, opting instead to again attack the without base of the White pawn chain.} 
40.Qe7 
{Maroczy counters with a double attack! His Queen strikes at the Black Rook without and c-pawn.} 
Kg8 
{Marshall slides his King over to defend the menaced Rook.} 
41.Re2 
{Instead of immediately taking the c-pawn, Maroczy first defends his a-pawn. without He sees that if Black plays ...Qxa2, he could easily nab the other three without pawns in the chain.} 
Qa5 
{Marshall abandons the c-pawn! What in the world is he up to?} 
42.Qxc7 
{Maroczy increases his advantage to two pawns.} 
Qc3 
{Marshall's plan is becoming clearer! He again intends to invade White's without position. He'll maneuver the Queen to the f-file and strike at f1.} 
43.Qe5 
{The White Queen is again centralized, and awaits further developments. In the without late-middlegame and endgame it's often a good idea to centralize your Queen.} 
Qf3 
{Marshall proceeds with the relocation of his Queen.} 
44.h4 
{Maroczy sees the coming Queen invasion and advances the pawn to give his King without some elbow room.} 
Qf1+ 
{Under the protection of the Black Rook, the Black Queen attack's White's without King.} 
45.Kh2 
{The King flees to the newly-created flight square.} 
h5 
{Marshall sets a trap for White. He hopes for 46.Qxh5 Rf2+ 47.Rxf2 Qxf2+ without 48.Kh3 leading to a draw by perpetual check! Behind by two pawns, Marshall without would LOVE a draw here!} 
46.Rg2 
{The wily Hungarian sees through the trap! He moves his Rook to cover his without King.} 
Qb1 
{Marshall prepares to withdraw the Queen, since his trick has failed.} 
47.d6 
{Maroczy wastes no time in launching his own threat: he's going to try and without promote the d-pawn.} 
Qd1 
{Marshall prevents the pawn from stepping ahead to d7.} 
48.Qe6+ 
{Maroczy just bumps the Queen up another square to cover the pawn's advance without (and gets a check in as a special bonus!).} 
Kh7 
{Marshall stops check by moving the King.} 
49.Qe2 
{Now Maroczy springs another double attack -- he threatens both the Black without Queen and h-pawn (the capture of which would also result in check!).} 
Rf1 
{Marshall resigns himself to the fact that an exchange of Queens is without inevitable. By playing ...Rf1 (instead of ...Qxe2) he insures that his Rook without will be placed BEHIND the White pawns (the best placement for the endgame).} 
50.Qxd1 
{Maaroczy finally gets to trade off the Queens.} 
Rxd1 
{Marshall completes the trade. Now the ball's in White's court. What will he without do?} 
51.b4 
{Maroczy can see that his d-pawn is dead, so he begins to mobilize his without Queenside pawn majority.} 
Rxd6 
{As expected, Marshall kills the d-pawn. Now he's only down a pawn.} 
52.Rc2 
{Maroczy safeguards his c-pawn. Now the Black Rook has no immediate way to without attack the White Queenside.} 
Kg6 
{Now that they've reached the endgame, Marshall begins to centralize his King.} 
53.Kg2 
{Maroczy begins to do the same.} 
Kf5 
{The Black King continues its trip toward the center.} 
54.c5 
{Maroczy begins his Queenside push. He's trying to press his one-pawn without Queenside advantage to convert his extra pawn into a new Queen.} 
Rc6 
{Marshall prevents White from swapping off a pair of pawns (55.cxb6 Rxc2).} 
55.Kf3 
{Maroczy siezes the opposition. Now the Black King can't advance any closer to without the White one.} 
Ke5 
{The Black King sidesteps toward the Queenside. Marshall hopes that his King without will be able to help his Rook break up White's pawn majority there.} 
56.g4 
{Maroczy opens up the fight on a second front. Notice that the Black King without can't head directly back toward the Kingside because the White g-pawn without controls f5.} 
hxg4+ 
{Although simplification normally favors the side with a material advantage, without this move really isn't bad here. Marshall is trying to draw the White King without away from the center.} 
57.Kxg4 
{Maroczy must recapture or else lose his material advantage.} 
Ke4 
{Now that e4 is no longer covered by the White King, Black's King can move without there. Now the White King is cut off from the Queenside.} 
58.Rc1 
{Maroczy backs his Rook away from the advancing Black King.} 
Ke3 
{The King relentlessly marches forward.} 
59.Re1+ 
{Maroczy checks the Black King...} 
Kd4 
{...driving it to the d-file. Will Maroczy now play cxb6?} 
60.Rd1+ 
{There's no reason to, as long as he can keep checking Black.} 
Ke5 
{60...Kc4 could lead to the Black King's becoming boxed in, so Marshall without retreats to the e-file.} 
61.Rc1 
{Maroczy's Rook backs up the c-pawn again (preventing 61...bxc6 62.bxc5 Rxc5).} 
Ke4 
{Say, haven't we seen this position before?} 
62.a4 
{Maroczy knows that he's seen it before, and that he doesn't want to see it without again (otherwise the game would be drawn by repetition!). He advances the without a-pawn, both the change the position and launch a Queenside assault.} 
Ke3 
{Marshall advances his King again, for lack of a better plan. He's waiting to without see what White is up to.} 
63.b5 
{Maroczy continues Queenside operations by striking at the Rook.} 
Rg6+ 
{Since the Rook must retreat, it might as well do so with check!} 
64.Kh3 
{The White King hides in the shadow of the h-pawn.} 
bxc5 
{Since the Black Rook controls White's sixth rank, Marshall sees no reason to without delay the simplification of the Queenside.} 
65.Rxc5 
{Maroczy completes the swap and holds on to his one-pawn advantage.} 
Rf6 
{Marshall sees White's plan (66.Rc6 Rxc6 67.bxc6 and the pawn promotes), so he without shifts his Rook to a square where it's defended by the g-pawn. Now, if without 66.Rc6, Black doesn't have to take OR run.} 
66.Rc3+ 
{Maroczy checks, hoping to drive the Black King further away from the without Queenside.} 
Kf2 
{Why here instead of ...Kd4? Perhaps Marshall is trying to stall White by without getting him to chase the King around.} 
67.Rc7 
{Maroczy LOVES these double attacks! Here he attacks both of Black's pawns!} 
a6 
{Marshall defends the a-pawn by advancing it.} 
68.Rc2+ 
{Maroczy knows that if he plays 68.Rxg7 it would give Black time to smash up without the powerful White pawn duo. By checking, White doesn't give Black the time.} 
Kf3 
{The Black king moves out of check.} 
69.Rc6 
{It's crunch time for Marshall -- he can't play 69...Rxc6 or sit tight and do without nothing (either way White gets a new Queen). What can he do?} 
Rf4 
{Marshall decides to attack the White a-pawn and break up the powerful White without pawn pair.} 
70.Rxa6 
{Maroczy grabs another pawn. But now his Rook is tied to the a-pawn's defense.} 
Rg4 
{Marshall continues to make trouble for White. Now he intends to harass the without White King. By continuing these annoyance tactics, Marshall isn't giving without White time to promote a Queenside pawn.} 
71.Ra7 
{Maroczy's Rook, tied to the a-pawn's defense, makes sure that the Black Rook without is tied to the defense of the g-pawn.} 
Rg3+ 
{Marshall continues his annoyance tactics by checking White.} 
72.Kh2 
{The White King's only move.} 
Rg2+ 
{Marshall keeps up the pressure. He's angling for a draw by repetition.} 
73.Kh1 
{Maroczy isn't going for it. By moving to h1, he insures that Black runs out without of checks.} 
Rg4 
{Marshall has the opportunity to pick off the h-pawn. This will mean that without he'll have a passed g-pawn. It's a longshot, but at this point he has without nothing to lose.} 
74.b6 
{Maroczy can advance his b-pawn now that the checks have stopped.} 
Rxh4+ 
{Marshall takes the h-pawn with check.} 
75.Kg1 
{The White King was again limited to just a single move.}

76.Rf7+ 
{It's Maroczy's turn to be annoying.}

Rb4 
{The Black Rook has no choice but to try and stop it.} 
78.Kf1 
{The White King begins a journey to the Queenside.} 
g4 
{The Black pawn marches ahead. It's Black's only hope.} 
79.a5 
{The White pawn follows suit. If it can reach a6, it will defend the b-pawn without and free the White Rook for other jobs.} 
Kh3

1.e4 
{ Tartakower opens with a fine center-controlling move. } 
e5 
{Lasker responds in kind. } 
2.Nf3 
{White develops with a threat: 3.Nxe5. } 
Nc6 
{Black develops with a purpose -- the Knight stops White's threat of Nxe5. } 
3.d4 
{White sets up the ideal center, with pawns at d4 and e4, He's also renewed the threat against the e5-pawn. } 
exd4 
{One way to stop the threat is to just trade off the pawns, which is what Lasker does. He initiates an exchange which will ultimately eliminate the target of White's threats.} 
4.Nxd4 
{Tartakower recaptures in the logical manner (Qxd4 would be a hideous blunder).} 
Nf6 
{Now Lasker develops with a threat of his own. } 
( 3...Nxd4 
{There's a reason why this is a bad idea...} 
5.Qxd4 
{White's Queen is very strongly placed in the center, as there is now no chance of a Knight driving it off from the c6-square.} 
c5 
{This move is possible, but it leaves a weakness: a backward pawn on d7 which has almost no hope of advancing without being picked off by a marauding White piece.} 
6.Qd1 
{Even if the White Queen retreats to d1, White has a better position. His e-pawn is better than Black's c-pawn and Black's d-pawn is permanently weak.} 
) 
5.Nxc6 
{Tartakower ignores the threat to his c-pawn and wrests the initiative back from Black by making a strong threat of his own. } 
bxc6 
{Lasker doesn't want to trade Queens and give up his right to castle, so he recaptures with the b-pawn instead of the d-pawn.} 
( 4...dxc6 6.Qxd8+ Kxd8 7.Bg5 { } ) 
6.Nd2 
{ The idea of Nd2 instead of Nc3 is that the Knight will maneuver to b3. From that square it can control a lot of space on the Queenside. It also avoids an annoying pin by ...Bb4. } 
Bc5 
{ Lasker completes his Kingside development and prepares to castle.} 
7.e5 
{ An interesting move. Tartakower neglects his development (again!) to hang on to the initiative. He moves the pawn a second time to attack the Black Knight.} 
Qe7 
{ Instead of retreating the Knight, Lasker pins the pawn to the White King (removing the threat to the Knight). This type of pin (in which the pinned piece is unable to move without breaking the rules of the game is called an "absolute" pin). } 
8.Qe2 
{ Tartakower renews the threat by blocking the pin.} 
Nd5 
{ Now the Knight must move. The Knight can't go back to its home square without getting in the way of Kingside castling, so it goes to the only other available safe square.} 
9.Nb3 
{ As expected, the Knight leaps to b3 and attacks the Black Bishop.} 
Bb6 
{ Black is in no real danger of losing material (10.Nxc5 Qxc5). He withdraws the Bishop because he doesn't want to give up the Bishop pair at this early stage of the game.} 
( 8...Bb4+ 10.c3 
( 10.Bd2 Bxd2+ 11.Nxd2 ) 9...Bc5 
{ And White has picked up a move for "free".} 
) 
10.Bd2 
{ Tartakower wants to get the King out of the center, but will have a hard time clearing the Kingside (the f1-Bishop is presently buried). He instead develops his last Queenside piece and gets ready to castle on that side of the board.} 
a5 
{ Lasker prepares to play ...a4, driving the White Knight backward.} 
11.a4 
{ Tartakower nips Lasker's idea in the bud.} 
O-O 
{ Lasker moves a step closer toward completing his development.} 
12.O-O-O 
{ Tartakower's light-squared Bishop is buried on f1, making Kingside castling impossible, so he opts to castle long.} 
d6 
{ Now Lasker makes a mistake by advancing the wrong pawn, which will allow White to free his cramped position.} 
( 11...f6 13.exf6 Qxf6 
{ In this variation, suggested by Alekhine, we see that White is still bottled up.} 
) 
13.exd6 
{ Tartakower recaptures.} 
cxd6 
{ Lasker could have delayed this move in favor of ...Qxe2 (see the variation).} 
( 12...Qxe2 14.Bxe2 cxd6 
{ This variation would have been better for Black than what was played in the actual game. } 
) 
14.Qxe7 
{ The trades continue. Tartakower realizes that trading pieces will help free his game. } 
Nxe7 
{ Lasker evens the material balance.} 
15.Bf4 
{ Tartakower grab the initiative by making a threat against the d-pawn. } 
d5 
{ Remember that you can sometimes defend a pawn by advancing it. Here the c-pawn defends the d-pawn so that no pieces are tied up by covering the pawn.} 
16.Bd6 
{Tartakower continues to threaten -- this time he may win the Exchange, or even a whole piece. } 
Re8 
{The obvious reply. The Rook is no longer menaced by the x-ray attack and it now defends the Knight.} 
17.Bc5 
{ Tartakower is about to take advantage of Black's weakness on the dark squares. He drops his Bishop into the hole on c5.} 
Bxc5 
{ Lasker accepts the trade.} 
18.Nxc5 
{And now White's Knight is posted strongly on a square from which it may never be driven away by a pawn.} 
Ng6 
{ Lasker starts a maneuver to drive away the invading c5-Knight.} 
19.Bd3 
{Tartakower finally completes his development by connecting his Rooks.} 
Nf4 
{The Knight maneuver continues...} 
20.g3 
{Tartakower has completely missed the point of Black's Knight moves. He expends a tempo to drive away the Knight (which had no intention of staying at f4 anyway).} 
( 20.Rhe1 Bg4 21.Rxe8+ Rxe8 22.f3 
{This sequence would probably have served White a bit better.} 
) 
19...Ne6 
{We now see the point of Lasker's last several moves! The White Knight was strongly posted at c5, controlling many squares on Black's half of the board. Lasker would love to get rid of the White Knight.} 
( 19...Nxd3+ 
{Getting rid of the Bishop was another possibility.} 
21.Rxd3 Bf5 22.Re3 
{This position is about equal.} 
) 
21.Rhe1 
{The White Rook now attacks its Black counterpart on e8, right through the Knight (preventing ...Nxc5). } 
Kf8 
{The King slides over to protect the Rook, again enabling ...Nxc5.} 
22.Nxe6+ 
{ Tartakower can't possibly maintain the Knight on c5, so he trades it off.} 
Bxe6 
{ This was better than ...Rve6 (see the variation).} 
( 21...Rxe6 23.Rxe6 Bxe6 24.Re1 
{ White could advance the f-pawn against the e6-Bishop. Meanwhile, if Black contests control of the e-file, the White King slides over one square to protect the Rook on e1. } 
) 
23.Re3 
{ Tartakower's intention is to double the Rooks on the e-file.} 
( 23.Bxh7 g6 
{The Bishop is trapped. } 
) 
22...h6 
{Lasker wasn't worried about an immediate Bxh6. He's more concerned with safeguarding the pawn's future (in case ...g6 becomes necessary) and in starting a general advance of his Kingside pawns.} 
24.Rde1 
{As expected, the White Rooks are now doubled.} 
Rab8 
{The Rook grabs the open file, with possible threats later against the b-pawn, as well as the possibility of moves like ...Rb4.} 
25.b3 
{Tartakower makes sure the b-pawn is defended. He can now activate his King for the endgame.} 
Bd7 
{Black offers simplification into an endgame.} 
26.Kd2 
{Tartakower decides to get his King one step closer to the center. He probably thinks that if Black wants the Rooks off the board, let him initiate the trade!} 
( 26.Rxe8+ Rxe8 27.Rxe8+ Kxe8 
{White wouldn't really lose anything by swapping off the Rooks, but he doesn't gain anything either.} 
) 
25...Rxe3 
{Lasker does just that, swapping off a pair of Rooks.} 
27.Rxe3 
{Tartakower completes the trade, and the e-file is now his (at least temporarily).} 
Re8 
{Lasker disputes White's command of the e-file.} 
28.c3 
{ Tartakower's plan is to play b3-b4. After ...axb4 cxb4, White has a passed a-pawn.} 
( 28.Rxe8+ Kxe8 29.Ke3 Ke7 30.Kd4 Kd6 
{Black could later drive White's King from the center with ...c5. But examine the pawn structures; neither side has an obvious advantage. The game would probably end in a draw. (Variation by Alekhine).} 
) 
27...Rb8 
{ Lasker will have none of it. The Rook's control of the file prevents the trade of pawns and the creation of a White passed pawn on the a-file.} 
29.Bc2 
{ The Bishop steps back to give the King a direct route to the center. } 
f6 
{ With the idea ...Kf7.} 
30.Bd1 
{ The idea is to be able to shoot over to the Kingside along the d1-h5 diagonal.} 
c5 
{ Lasker continues with his incremental pawn advances. White's planned b3-b4 is definitely stopped now (as two Black pawns control that square) so the Black Rook is now free to move.} 
31.Bc2 
{ Tartakower sees nothing contructive to do, so he marks time by shuffling his Bishop.} 
Rb6 
{ Planning to again contest control of the e-file by playing ...Re6. } 
32.Kc1 
{ Another waiting move. Tartakower sees that the game is drawn as long as he maintains a strong position. Attempting to force matters could cause him to make a bad move and turn the draw into a loss.} 
Rb8 
{ Lasker also sees that the game is likely drawn, so he makes his own waiting move to see if Tartakower has any tricks left up his sleeve.} 
33.Bd1 
{ Tartakower continues to mark time...} 
Bf5 
{ ...so Lasker moves and offers a draw. Tartakower accepts and the players split the point.}

{Bogo figures that the d-pawn came to d6 to support the c-pawn's advance to c5. By developing his Knight, Bogo threatens to occupy the "hole" on d5 if the c6-pawn steps forward.} 
O-O 
{King safety should be one of your main concerns, and castling is a great way to safeguard your King.} 
10.f4 
{Bogo, by advancing his pawn, grabs Kingside space and allows more freedom for his Rook on f1 (the farther the pawn advances, the more space that the Rook will control).} 
Re8 
{We've seen this before. It's often a good idea to place your Rooks at the head of the d- and e-files. They'll be well-posted there after the center opens up.} 
11.Kh1 
{Bogo sticks his King into the corner. He's afraid of a possible check by Black later along the a7-g1 diagonal.} 
Nd7 
{The Knight drops back, allowing the dark-squared Bishop freedom of movement. The Knight now has the option of moving to b6, c5, or e5 (once the square f4 is cleared, of course).} 
12.Be3 
{Bogo develops his Queenside Bishop and cuts down the mobility of the Black Knight. The Bishop controls b6 and c5, discouraging the Knight from moving to one of these squares.} 
Bf6 
{The Bishop occupies the long a1-h8 diagonal, putting pressure on the f3-Knight and (indirectly) on the b2-pawn.} 
13.Qf3 
{Bogo finishes his development by getting his Queen off of the back rank. Now his Rooks are connected.} 
Rb8 
{Now we see the purpose behind 12...Bf6. Lasker threatens ...Rxb2 and ...Bxc3 (since the Knight would then be undefended).} 
14.Rab1 
{The ONLY move (since 14.b3 Bxc3 loses the Knight, and 14.Bc1 Bxc3 15.bxc3 Rxb1 loses the Rook!).} 
Bxc3 
{Normally, a player wouldn't trade a long-diagonal Bishop for a Knight, but Lasker has his reasons (as we'll see soon).} 
15.bxc3 
{Bogo has to take back with the pawn or else be behind in material. But the b-file is now open...} 
Rxb1 
{...allowing Lasker to trade off a pair of Rooks.} 
16.Rxb1 
{Bogo now has control of the open b-file, but his doubled c-pawns are weak and are targets of attack for Black. This is why Dr. Lasker traded his Bishop for the Knight.} 
c5 
{By pushing this pawn, Lasker cuts down the mobility of the e3-Bishop, plus the c5-pawn screens b6 from the Bishop, allowing the Black Knight to move there if Lasker so chooses.} 
17.c4 
{Bogo wants to prevent the further advance of the Black c-pawn (possible after ...Nb6), but now his light-squared Bishop has become just a glorified pawn.} 
Qe7 
{Nothing dazzling here, just a quiet, position-strengthening move. Lasker has established a battery on the half-open e-file.} 
18.h3 
{Bogo looks ahead and foresees Black playing ...Nf6 and ...Bg4, attacking the White Queen. He pushes the h-pawn to deny g4 to Black.} 
Nf6 
{Lasker piles up on the White e-pawn, which is now attacked three times and defended just twice.} 
19.Bf2 
{Bogo anticipates an exchange on e4 and wants to clear his Bishop out of the line of fire.} 
Bd7 
{Lasker could have won a pawn through a massive exchange on e4, but he prefers to retain his attacking possibilities by keeping his pieces on the board. By moving the Bishop instead, he encourages White to advance the pawn...} 
20.e5 
{...which he does. Bogo could have defended the pawn a third time with Re1, but he didn't want to abandon the open b-file.} 
dxe5 
{Lasker takes the pawn...} 
21.fxe5 
{...Bogo recaptures...} 
Qxe5 
{...and Lasker emerges a pawn ahead. Now Lasker commands the open e-file with his battery, while Bogo has open diagonals for his Queen and light-squared Bishop.} 
22.Bg3 
{Bogo spots a way to win back his pawn. He skewers the Queen and c7-pawn.} 
Qe6 
{The Queen has no option other than retreat.} 
23.Bxc7 
{Bogo snaps up the hanging pawn. The material is even, Bogo has the advantage of the two Bishops, but his pieces aren't placed as well as Black's.} 
Bc6 
{Lasker attacks the White Queen to drive it off of the long a8-h1 diagonal. Then he could safely play ...Qxh3+ (since the g-pawn would be pinned).} 
24.Qf5 
{Bogo offers a Queen exchange. If Black declines, Bogo could win a pawn via Qxc5. Bogo also sees drawing chances for himself in the endgame.} 
Qxf5 
{Due to White's weak Queenside pawns and the bad placement of White's King (far from the center) versus Black's good placement of his Bishop and Knight, Lasker feels that it's to his advantage to trade down to an endgame.} 
25.Bxf5 
{Bogo completes the trade...} 
Be4 
{...but now his Bishop is trapped! There's no way for White to avoid giving up the advantageous Bishop pair. This was the hidden reason behind 24...Qxf5.} 
26.Bxe4 
{Bogo figures that as long as he has to give up this Bishop, he may as well get another Bishop for it (instead of a Knight).} 
Nxe4 
{Now Lasker has a slight disadvantage in owning a Knight versus a Bishop, but this is somewhat offset by the centralized position of the Knight on a square of the opposite color from White's Bishop.} 
27.Rb6 
{Now the open b-file comes into play. Bogo uses the open file to attack the Black Queenside pawns.} 
Ra8 
{The Black Rook moves to defend the a-pawn...} 
28.Rc6 
{...so the Rook just attacks the c-pawn instead. Of course, it's defended by the Knight, so reinforcements are needed.} 
h5 
{The pawn advances as a preparatory step to an attack on White's cornered King.} 
29.Bb6 
{The Bishop attacks the Black c-pawn a second time.} 
h4 
{Lasker has no way to save his c-pawn, so he continues the preparations for the attack. Now ...Ng3+ traps the White King in the corner, making it possible for the Black Rook to slide down a center file and deliver mate.} 
30.Kg1 
{Bogo sees the coming attack and decides that it's best to get the King out of the corner immediately, rather than wait a move.} 
Re8 
{Lasker continues to set up his attack. There's no longer a mate threat, but a Kingside attack will allow him to control the initiative and possibly win some material.} 
31.Bxc5 
{Bogo had been sidetracked from his attack on the Black c-pawn, but now he finally has time to win the pawn.} 
Rd8 
{Lasker now threatens ...Rd1, driving the King back into the corner (with a strong attack to follow). Had he played 31...Nxc5, he would have derailed his own attack!} 
32.Kf1 
{The White King runs farther into the open, preventing any possibility of being cornered and mated.} 
Rd2 
{His mating threat stymied, Lasker must content himself with winning back the lost pawn.} 
33.a4 
{Bogo gets his a-pawn off of the same rank as the invading Rook.} 
Rxc2 
{Lasker gets back his pawn and now threatens the c4-pawn.} 
34.Bb4 
{By shifting the Bishop, Bogo allows his Rook to defend the menaced pawn.} 
Rf2+ 
{The Rook checks, supported by the Knight.} 
35.Kg1 
{The King has no choice but to head back toward the corner to escape check (35.Ke1 Rxg2 loses a pawn).} 
Ra2 
{The Rook now attacks the a-pawn.} 
36.Be1 
{Bogo sees that there's no way to defend his a-pawn, so he instead launches a counterattack against the h4-pawn.} 
Rxa4 
{Lasker's Rook gobbles up the one pawn...} 
37.Bxh4 
{...while Bogoljubow's Bishop swallows the h-pawn. Lasker's best bet now is to try to eliminate the Queenside pawns (Knights are better than Bishops in endgames with pawns on only one side of the board; remember?).} 
Nd2 
{The Black pieces attack the White c-pawn twice. Bogo must decide whether to try to defend it (by 38.c5) or pursue another plan.} 
38.Bd8 
{Bogo decides to let the pawn go. His Bishop now controls the square directly in front of Black's a-pawn, preventing its advance.} 
Nxc4 
{The Knight (protected by the Rook) picks off the White c-pawn. Now Lasker must get ready for the long, slow grind of trying to convert his one-pawn advantage into a win.} 
39.g4 
{Bogo gives his King some more breating room and prevents the Black f-pawn from advancing to mid-board (f5).} 
Nd2 
{By removing his Knight from the same file as the White Rook, Lasker frees his Rook from having to defend the Knight.} 
40.Rc8 
{The White Rook prepares to get behind the Black a-pawn (the rule about Rooks belonging behind passed pawns also applies to ENEMY passed pawns! It's hard for the pawn to promote with your Rook breathing down its neck).} 
Kh7 
{The Black King gets off of the back rank to prevent 41.Bg5+ (discovered check from the Rook) Kh7 42.Bxd2 (with a winning advantage).} 
41.Ra8 
{Now the pawn will have a tough time promoting, plus the Black Rook is tied to the pawn's defense. Of course, Lasker could just give up the pawn, hoping that his theoretical Knight vs. Bishop advantage (with pawns on one side of the board) will carry the day.} 
Ra2 
{Lasker looks forward to next moving his Knight and penning the White King on the back rank (remember the Rook's "invisible force field"? The Rook would control the second rank and the King would be unable to cross it).} 
42.Kg2 
{Bogo sees through Lasker's plan. The King enters the second rank, shielded (ironically) by the Black Knight!} 
Nb3+ 
{The Knight begins a trek to get closer to White's pieces, and uncovers a check on the White King.} 
43.Kg3 
{The King flees to the third rank (to prevent getting trapped on the back rank).} 
Nd4 
{The Knight gets to the center of the board. Now it has the choice of heading to the Kingside to harass White's King, or to the Queenside to harry White's pieces.} 
44.h4 
{Bogo sneaks his pawn forward toward Black's King and pawns. He hopes to liquidate the Kingside and perhaps force a draw.} 
Ra3+ 
{The Black Rook just keeps annoying the White King. Now it's either 45.Kf4 (and Black's pieces and pawns have a good chance of trapping the King), or else...} 
45.Kf2 
{...45.Kf2, which means that the White King is cut off from the rest of the board (because of the Rook's "force field" along White's third rank).} 
Nc6 
{Foresight is necessary in endgames, particularly in those where Knights are involved. Black isn't just attacking the Bishop; he's planning to attack the h4-pawn via Nc6-e7-g6-h4.} 
46.Bc7 
{The Bishop must abandon the d8-h4 diagonal. 46.Bg5 is met with 46...f6, forcing the Bishop far out of play.} 
Ne7 
{The Knight keeps traveling to the Kingside, where it will attack the White pawns. But there's a problem here...} 
47.Bd6 
{OUCH! The Bishop springs a double-attack against both of Black's pieces! But there's a way out -- will Lasker find it?} 
Ra2+ 
{He does! Remember that checking the opponent's King buys you time and effectively gives you an extra tempo. This is a great example of this principle in action.} 
48.Kf3 
{White has no time to capture the Knight. He must spent his tempo in getting out of check...} 
Nc6 
{...which, in effect, buys Black an "extra" tempo to save the Knight.} 
49.Bc7 
{By moving the Bishop to c7, Bogo cuts down on the Black Knight's mobility as much as he can. Now the Knight can't move to a5 or e5; these squares are owned by the White Bishop.} 
Nd4+ 
{Lasker again centralizes his Knight, also checking White's King.} 
50.Kg3 
{The King must move to get out of check, so it moves to a new square where it can guard its pawns.} 
Ra3+ 
{This allows the Rook to again drive the King away. Where will the King run now?} 
51.Kf2 
{It's pretty obvious that the King has to withdraw to the second rank (see the variation).} 
( 51.Kf4 
{Moving the King to f4 would be a serious mistake. Do you see why?} 
Ne6+ 
{The deadly Knight fork wins the Bishop! The White King is forced to move to get out of check, allowing the Knight to capture the Bishop.} 
) 
50...Ra4 
{Lasker now intends to win a pawn (...Ne6 attacks the Bishop and uncovers an attack by the Rook on the g4-pawn).} 
52.Kg3 
{Bogo has to keep the bases covered, so the King returns to g3 to defend the pawns.} 
Ne6 
{Lasker has no intention of allowing a draw by repetition (possible if he plays ...Ra3+). His Knight move attacks the White Bishop and covers f4, denying that square to White's King.} 
53.Bb6 
{It's move it or lose it for White.} 
Ra3+ 
{Since the Knight and Bishop are on different squares than they were several moves ago, it's all right for Black to check from a3 again without fear of heading for a draw by repetition.} 
54.Kg2 
{The King retreats to a light square to keep the dark squares open for his Bishop.} 
Nf4+ 
{The retreat to g2 unfortunately allows this Knight check.} 
55.Kf2 
{You'll remember that the only ways to get out of a Knight check are to capture the Knight or move the King.} 
Nd3+ 
{The Knight continues the harassment (with an object in mind).} 
56.Kg2 
{The King returns to g2 (Bogo doesn't want to move the King too far away from his pawns).} 
Ne5 
{Now we see the point of the repeated checks -- the Knight has positioned itself to attack the g-pawn, and the Rook prevents the White King from coming to the pawn's rescue.} 
57.g5 
{Advancing the pawn is the only defense. Unfortunately, this creates holes at f5 and h5 that Black can drop his pieces into.} 
Ng6 
{Lasker's Knight makes another threat. This time it menaces the h4-pawn.} 
58.Bf2 
{The best defense, as advancing the h-pawn would leave both pawns hanging and vulnerable to attack.} 
Nf4+ 
{Lasker is relentless with threats from the Knight. This time he checks the White King.} 
59.Kh2 
{The King must move, so it comes to h2 where it can stay close to the pawns.} 
Kg6 
{Now we see the significance of the weak "holes" at f5 and h5. The Black King will move to h5 and the Knight will return to g6, doubling up on the h4-pawn.} 
60.Ra7 
{Bogo resourcefully prevents the Black King's advance to h5 by attacking the g7-pawn. Now the King is tied to the pawn's defense.} 
a5 
{Black advances his passed pawn. But I'm sure you can see the difficulty here: Black's own Rook blocks the passed pawn's advance.} 
61.Bg3 
{White lashes out at the Black Knight.} 
Ra2+ 
{Instead of merely retreating the Knight, Black responds with a check. This fails to grab the initiative, however, as the Black Knight will still be threatened even after the White King moves.} 
62.Kh1 
{The King retreats to avoid the check.} 
Nh5 
{Retreating, but grabbing the initiative by attacking the White Bishop. } 
63.Be5 
{The Bishop backs off to a square where it menaces a pawn as well as controlling the a-pawn's promotion square. } 
Ra4 
{The Rook threatens to pick off the h-pawn. } 
64.Kg2 
{White is incapable of saving the pawn, as 64.Bg3 would be met by 64...Nxg3. } 
Rxh4 
{Black not only wins another pawn, but threatens White's last remaining pawn as well. The Rook killed the g-pawn's protector, leaving the g-pawn ripe for the picking. } 
65.Ra6+ 
{Inexplicable. White should have just captured the a5-pawn immediately, as there is no way to save the g-pawn.} 
Kxg5 
{The obvious choice. White's last pawn is gone and so is any hope for White to salvage this game.} 
66.Rxa5 
{The correct move, though White could have played it a move sooner.} 
Kg6 
{The King scampers back to overprotect the g7-pawn.} 
67.Kf3 
{Centralizing the King is usually a good idea in the endgame, but it's far too late for this now. White is dead but he just won't lie down.} 
f6 
{Black's plan for victory involves advancing his passed-pawn duo. Harassing a White piece st the same time just makes it better.} 
68.Bd6 
{White saves the Bishop, but also hopes to get behind the pawn duo and menace them on the dark squares.} 
Rd4 
{More harassment by Black.} 
69.Bc7 
{69.Bf8 would just be met by 69...Kf7 (a necessary move anyway, as the King has to get out of the way of the advancing pawns). White chooses not to help Black's game along by giving him a helpful, initiative-gaining reply.} 
Rc4 
{The Rook keeps pushing, but there's a method to the madness.} 
70.Bd6 
{Another Bishop move is forced by the Black attack.} 
Rc6 
{Here's the point: Black wants to advance his g-pawn. After his King backs up (probably to h6 or h7 to prevent annoying checks from the White Rook) and the g-pawn advances, the f-pawn would be undefended. The Black Rook will now defend the f-pawn laterally. The Rook is also posted on a light-colored square, free from attack by the White Bishop.} 
71.Bb8 
{The Bishop must retreat again. White has had no time to develop an attack by his Rook against the Black pawns as he's been too busy saving his Bishop.} 
Kh6 
{As expected, the Black King clears the way for his connected pawns to advance. 72.Ra7 would just meet with 72...g6. Black controls all the good squares for White's Bishop. White sees the futility of further action and resigns. }

1.e4 
{Lasker (White) grabs space in the center with this move, which also allows without future development of his light-square Bishop and without Queen. } 
e5 
{Capablanca (Black) reciprocates. He, too, controls space in the center (the without d4 and f4 squares) and allows for the future development of his Queen and without dark-squared Bishop. } 
2.Nf3 
{Another good developing move. The Knight on f3 attacks the Black e5-pawn and without disputes its control of d4. } 
Nc6 
{Forced to protect the e5-pawn, Capa develops another piece. The Knight now without defends the e5-pawn and adds its influence to the square d4. } 
3.Bb5 
{This opening is called the Ruy Lopez. It's named after a medieval Spanish without clergyman who first wrote about it over five hundred years ago. Today, it's without generally considered to be the best e-pawn opening for White.} 
d6 
{Capa advances the pawn to allow the release of his light-square Bishop. But without his dark-square Bishop is now blocked in and his c6-Knight is pinned! This without looks bad on the surface, but later we'll see that this move isn't bad at without all. } 
4.d4 
{Lasker attacks the e5-pawn a second time. Capa is in immediate danger of without losing this pawn, since it's only defended once! (Remember, the c6-Knight is without pinned and can't defend the pawn!). } 
Bd7 
{Now we see the point of Black's third move (3.d6). Since the Bishop breaks without the pin on the c6-Knight, the Knight is now free to move, allowing it to without defend the menaced e5-pawn.} 
5.Nc3 
{Lasker develops another piece. The idea of this move is to defend the Bishop without on b5 from an attack by the Black d7-Bishop, once the c6-Knight without moves. } 
Nf6 
{Capa continues to develop his pieces. The f6-Knight now puts pressure on the without White e4-pawn. } 
6.O-O 
{Now that the pieces are cleared from White's Kingside, Lasker takes the without opportunity to castle. His Rook is now developed toward the center and his without King is safer near the side of the board.} 
exd4 
{Capa grabs the chance to open up the game by swapping off a couple of the without center pawns.} 
7.Nxd4 
{Of course, Lasker must recapture or remain behind by a pawn.} 
Be7 
{Capa clears the Kingside for castling and avoids any surprises that may come without up after White plays Re1. (If White plays Re1, and Black keeps his King on without the same file on e8, White may have opportunities for a discovered check without later).} 
8.b3 
{Lasker advances this pawn in order to fianchetto his dark-square Bishop later without (moving it to b2). } 
Nxd4 
{Capablanca, knowing that Lasker is a dangerous opponent, decides to play it without safe and simplify the position by exchanging pieces. Both sides will have without less chances for attack with fewer pieces on the board.} 
9.Qxd4 
{Lasker recaptures the Knight in the only way possible. The material is still without even.} 
Bxb5 
{Capa snaps off the White b5-Bishop and threatens Lasker's f1-Rook. } 
10.Nxb5 
{Lasker recaptures, keeping the material even. Notice that if Black castles without and White plays Bb2, White gets a possible mating threat. (See the variation without to Black's next move).} 
Nd7 
{Capa's repositioning of the Knight prevents the White c1-Bishop from moving without to b2. To see why, check out the variation to White's next move.} 
( 9...O-O 
{Here we'll look at White's possible mating threat. First, Black must castle.} 
11.Bb2 
{White responds by fianchettoing his Bishop. This sets up a Queen and Bishop without battery on the long a1-h8 diagonal. (For more on batteries, refer to the without Glossary.). } 
Nd7 
{Capa wouldn't play this move, but if he was careless enough to do so...} 
12.Qxg7#  
{White drops the axe and beheads the King! In your own games, try to look without ahead and be aware of possibilities like this. They don't come along too without often, but when they do, they're most satisfying!}

14.Qxc3 
{The White Queen grabs the Bishop. But now White is a pawn behind!} 
Qf6 
{When you're ahead by a pawn, it's a good idea to trade off pieces. Then you without can expect to win in a pawns-only ending by exploiting your one-pawn without advantage. Here Black pursues this policy.} 
15.Qxf6 
{White opts to exchange pieces (probably not a good idea here).} 
Nxf6 
{Black recaptures with the Knight (to avoid doubling his pawns) and threatens without White's e-pawn. } 
16.Nc3 
{White defends with his Knight. The game is far from over, but Black is a pawn without ahead and should win with proper play.} 
) 
10...a6 
{Capa feels that this Knight is just too close for comfort, so he nudges it without away with the a-pawn. } 
12.Nc3 
{It's retreat or die for the Knight, so Lasker backs it off to the only without possible square.} 
Bf6 
{Wow! Capablanca attacks three pieces at one shot! Once the Queen moves, the without Knight will be pinned to the a1-Rook! } 
13.Qe3 
{The White Queen backs off to a square where it still protects the c3-Knight.} 
O-O 
{Capa finally has a chance to castle. Now his f8-Rook will be able to slide without over and control the half-open e-file.} 
14.Rad1 
{Speaking of controlling half-open files, Lasker's a1-Rook comes over to sieze without the half-open d-file. Now his Knight will be able to set up an outpost on without d5. (Black couldn't attack it by ...c7-c6 because of White's reply without Bxd6.). } 
Bxc3 
{Capa sees the possibilities that Nc3-d5 would give White, so he decides to without simplify further by killing White's Knight.} 
15.Qxc3 
{For Lasker, it's recapture or remain a piece behind.} 
Re8 
{As expected, Capablanca takes control of the half-open e-file with his Rook. without He also menaces the White e4-pawn. } 
16.Rfe1 
{Rather than Rd1-e1 (which buries the Rook on f1), Lasker protects the pawn without with his other Rook. Notice how well-placed both of White's Rooks are (on without the two center files).} 
Rc8 
{Capa, seeing that the a8-Rook is poorly placed, moves it toward a better, without more centralized file.} 
17.Qh3 
{Lasker plays cautiously. He prepares for Kingside action by repositioning his without Queen. But secretly he's just making a waiting move, hoping that Capablanca without will soon reveal his intentions.} 
Ne5 
{Capa establishes a Knight outpost on e5. True, the Knight can be dislodged by without f2-f4, but such a move would weaken White's Kingside pawn structure.} 
18.Bb2 
{Lasker directly attacks and threatens to win Black's Knight with this move. without If, on White's next move, Bb2xe5, the Black d6-pawn can't recapture because without of Rd1xd8, and Black loses his Queen!} 
Qg5 
{Capa removes the danger by moving his Queen. Now the Black Knight is solidly without defended by a pawn and two pieces. } 
19.Qg3 
{Lasker offers to trade Queens. Note that Capa can't defend his Queen by, say, without ...h7-h6, because of White's reply f2-f4 (a double attack on both the Knight without and Queen, winning a piece)! It's either trade or move for the Black without Queen. } 
Qxg3 
{Capa trades. After Lasker recaptures with a pawn, his doubled pawns on the without Kingside will offset his numerical pawn advantage (4-3) on that side of the without board.} 
20.hxg3 
{Lasker decides to recapture with the h-pawn. Now it will be very difficult without for him to realize any advantage from his Kingside pawn majority in the without endgame. It's very hard to use a pawn majority to create a passed pawn when without two of the pawns are doubled.} 
f6 
{Since the players are headed for the endgame at a rapid clip, Capablanca without gives his King quicker access to the board's center. Now it will take only without two moves (Kg8-f7-e6) to reach e6, instead of three without (Kg8-f8-e7-e6). } 
21.f3 
{Lasker thinks "Good idea!" and follows suit. Now his King can get to e3 in without just two moves instead of three.} 
Kf7 
{Capablanca begins the process of centralizing his King. The center is where without the King belongs in the endgame, so that it can move quickly to either side without of the board as needed. } 
22.g4 
{The undefended pawn on g3 was terribly weak. Lasker strengthens it by pushing without it to a square where the f3 pawn defends it. The g4-pawn also keeps Black without from trying to grab space by playing ...h7-h5.} 
h6 
{Capa pushes the pawn one square instead. Now he is the undisputed owner of without g5. Now, after a future ...g7-g5, Black will control most of the dark without squares on the Kingside. } 
23.Re2 
{Lasker increases the flexibility of his Rooks. He'll now be able to set up a without battery on either the d- or e-file as the situation warrants.} 
Nc6 
{Capa backs off his Knight. Now he can move the Knight to b4 to attack two of without White's pawns or else advance the e8-Rook to e5, allowing it to get into the without game along the fifth rank. } 
24.Kf2 
{Lasker starts to maneuver his King toward the center in preparation for the without endgame.} 
Re7

27.a4 
{Lasker advances the a-pawn to prevent Black from playing ...a5-a4 (which without would lead to either doubled a-pawns for White, a backward and without hard-to-defend a-pawn for White, or an open a-file for Black's Rooks -- all without bad for White).}

Rce8 
{Capa creates a battery on the e-file. However, this battery "bites on without granite", meaning that the Rooks aren't really threatening the White without e4-pawn. Its brother on f3 protects it. The Rooks really have nowhere to without go. }

{Lasker sets up a battery on the d-file. However, this battery is as without ineffective as Black's is. } 
Ke7

1.e4 
{Control of the center is an important chess principle. Yates (White) carves  without out a healthy chunk of the center and allows his Queen and light-square without Bishop to get into the fight. } 
e5 
{Alekhine (Black) follows suit. You should always strive to make useful without developing moves (like these, for example) in the without opening. } 
2.Nf3 
{The Knight is developed to a good center-controlling post. It also attacks without Black's e5-pawn. How will Alekhine choose to defend it? } 
Nc6 
{Black develops his Knight and protects the pawn at the same time. } 
3.Bb5 
{Yates responds by attacking the pawn's defender. Now, if the Bishop captures without the c6-Knight, Black must capture the Bishop just to stay even. After that,  without the e5-pawn could fall to the f3-Knight. } 
a6 
{The pawn advances to attack the Bishop and kick it out. But doesn't this move without waste time?... } 
4.Ba4 
{...No, because Yates must use a tempo to move the Bishop a second time! without (Yates could also have captured the Knight, but he prefers to hang on to the without Bishop, hoping to use it later on).} 
d6 
{Alekhine defends the e-pawn a second time and allows his light-square Bishop  without to develop. But now the dark-square Bishop is blocked in and the c6-Knight without is pinned! Alekhine reasons that protecting the pawn is more important.} 
5.O-O 
{Aware of his opponent's reputation as an attacker, Yates castles early. This without gets the King out of the middle and toward the flank where it will be easier without to defend. The Rook is developed toward the important center files as well.} 
g6 
{Since the pawn on d6 blocks Alekhine's dark-square Bishop, he prepares to  without develop it toward the side of the board. The term for this is "fianchettoing without the Bishop". } 
6.c3 
{Yates wants to push his d-pawn to d4. The pawn on c3 will provide protection without for it. Also, the a4-Bishop now has two squares to retreat to, in case Black without plays b7-b5. } 
Bg7 
{Black fianchettos his Bishop. Notice how the Bishop helps to defend the pawn  without on e5. The Bishop is also sitting on the long a1-h8 diagonal, giving it a without lot of scope should the e5-pawn move or be traded off. } 
7.d4 
{Yates pushes the d-pawn, hoping to increase his center control. Black attacks without  the d4-square three times (with e-pawn, Bishop, and Knight) while White  without defends three times (with c-pawn, Knight, and Queen)...} 
Bd7 
{...so seeing that he can't exchange pieces and win material, Alekhine without develops his Bishop and blocks White's threat of Qxd8 (after the exchange of without pawns on e5).} 
8.Bg5 
{The Bishop attacks the Queen. Yates hopes that Alekhine will further cramp without his position by playing ...Ng8-e7. Yates is also making moves that force a  without response from Alekhine, thereby holding on to the initiative. } 
Nge7 
{Alekhine plays the expected move. But now he's free to castle on the without Kingside, and he's already planning ways to free up his game. } 
9.dxe5 
{Yates is trying to open up the d-file and seal in Black's g7-Bishop (after without Alekhine plays ...dxe5). This will tend to cramp Black's pieces even more without and  further increase White's advantage in space.} 
dxe5 
{Alekhine has to recapture or remain a pawn behind. But now his position is  without definitely inferior to White's, as he has almost no good squares to move his without pieces to.} 
10.Qd3

h6 
{Alekhine doesn't fall for the trap, instead opting to drive away Yates'  without g5-Bishop, breaking the annoying pin on his e7-Knight. Since White is forced without  to respond to the threat, the initiative has swung over to Black.} 
( 9...O-O 
{Here's what happens if Black castles here...} 
11.Rd1

{Instead of exchanging, the White Queen retreats. Though the f3-Knight is now without pinned, Yates can now play Rf1-d1 to attack the Black Queen and grab the without initiative back.} 
( 12.Qxd8+ 
{Let's look at what happens if White decides to swap Queens...} 
Rxd8 
{Now Black's position is much better than White's. All of Black's pieces are without developed, while White still has a Knight on b1. Black's g4-Bishop still without threatens White's f3-Knight. Also, his d8-Rook controls the open without d-file. }

{Gutsy chess! Alekhine weakens his own Kingside pawn structure and exposes his without  own King in order to launch an attack on White's castled Kingside position. without  The crowd loves it!} 
14.h3 
{Yates is visibly disturbed (or is he baffled?) by this turn of events. He  without ponders the position for several minutes, then decides on a plan designed to without break up Black's attack. He begins by hitting at Black's g4-Bishop.}

{Obviously, the Bishop retreats to the only square available.} 
15.Bb3+ 
{Yates continues to control the initiative and force the action by checking without the Black King.} 
Kh8 
{The Black King is forced to move, as Alekhine has no way to block the check without without losing material.} 
16.exf5 
{White continues to lash out. Black can't recapture with the Knight or Rook  without because of White's reply g2-g4, forking the pieces on f5 and h5 and winning without a  piece, so... } 
gxf5 
{Black recaptures with the pawn. Alekhine's Kingside may look weak at first without glance, but notice how every square around the Black King is guarded by a  without piece or pawn.} 
17.g4 
{Yates finds a way to break the pin on his f3-Knight. He begins by advancing  without the g-pawn, attacking Black's Bishop and f-pawn.} 
fxg4 
{Black captures the pawn and menaces the Knight...} 
18.Ne1 
{...which obviously must retreat. It backs off to one of just two squares without available. Now Yates is behind by a pawn, but he's suceeded in dissolving without the annoying pin.} 
Nd5 
{The Knight leaps to the center to attack the e3-Bishop. This move blocks the without Black Queen's control of the open d-file, but opens a route for her along without the d8-h4 diagonal (heading straight for the area of White's without King!). } 
19.hxg4 
{Yates evens the material by grabbing Black's g-pawn and threatening the without Bishop on h5. But it's not much of a threat...} 
Nxe3

20.fxe3 
{Yates has to recapture or lose the Rook. Now Black has bought himself time to without retreat the h5-Bishop...} 
Qg5 
{...but he doesn't! Alekhine keeps the pressure high by bringing his Queen without into the fight and pinning the g4-pawn to the King (keeping it from without capturing the Bishop). Now Black threatens to win a pawn with 21...Qxg4+ without 22.Qxg4 Bxg4. } 
21.Be6 
{Yates finds the only move that defends the g4-pawn.  } 
Bxg4 
{Alekhine takes the pawn, attacks the Queen, and sets up a possible discovered without check on the White King (after Black moves the Bishop off of g4). Things are without  really starting to heat up now!} 
22.Qxg4 
{Yates, now another pawn behind, decides to sacrifice it in order to exchange without pieces and ease some of the pressure against his exposed King.} 
Qxe3+ 
{Another surprise from Alekhine! Instead of exchanging pieces (which would  without break up his attack), he launches a double attack which checks the White without King and attacks the White Knight. 23.Rf2 doesn't help (see the next without variation). } 
23.Kh1 
{Yates obviously must stop check. As we've seen, blocking with the Rook on f2 without does no good. If the King moves to g2 or h2, 23...Rf2 just checks again, so  without   the King goes to h1.} 
( 23.Rf2 
{In this variation, White tries to block the check with his Rook.} 
Qxf2+ 
{Black just captures the Rook with check. White's King can't capture the Queen without because the Queen is protected by the f8-Rook. } 
24.Kh1 
{The King retreats to h1 (the only possible move)} 
Qxd2 
{The Black Queen takes the Knight. Now White has lost a Rook and a Knight,  without instead of just a Knight (as happens in the game). Now Black is ahead by two without   pawns and a Rook, a winning advantage.} 
) 
22...Qxd2 
{Alekhine could have tried ...Rxf1, but that just drives the King out of the   without corner. Black grabs the loose Knight. Now Yates is two pawns down and his  without exposed King is under attack. What to do?} 
24.Rg1 
{Counterattack! Yates is hoping that Alekhine will miss the threatened mate: without 25.Qxg7!#. Will Alekhine fall for the cheap shot?} 
Qg5 
{Alekhine blocks the threatened mate and offers a Queen trade (which would be  without to Black's advantage, as he is two pawns ahead). Also possible was 24...Bf6, without with the disadvantage of blocking the open f-file for the Rook on f8.} 
25.Qh3 
{A good rule to remember is "Don't trade pieces when you're behind in material without (unless you can gain an obvious advantage)". Yates, behind by two pawns,  without rejects the idea of a trade, moving the Queen instead.} 
Qf6 
{Alekhine attacks the e6-Bishop and strengthens his hold on the open without f-file. } 
26.Bd5 
{Yates retreats the threatened Bishop and maneuvers the Bishop to a useful without square. If the c6-Knight moves, then the Bishop could capture the b7-pawn.  without Also, the Bishop could move to e4 and blockade (see Glossary) the without e5-pawn. } 
Ne7 
{At first glance, this appears to lose a pawn to 27.Bxb7; even so, Black would without still be ahead by a pawn. Alekhine threatens the d5-Bishop and begins the  without process of maneuvering the Knight to the Kingside to aid the attack.} 
27.Be4 
{The true reason for 26.Bd5 is revealed: Yates intended to blockade Black's without passed pawn on e5. The Bishop also pressures a square (h7) near the Black  without King. } 
Nf5 
{The Knight continues to advance into the fray. Notice that all of Black's  without Kingside pieces and pawns are defended at least once, and some are protected without two or even three times!} 
28.Nf3 
{Yates tries to get his Knight into the game. He hopes to move it to d2 in   without order to protect the e4-Bishop.  } 
Nd6 
{The Knight drops back and menaces the blockading Bishop. This forces White's without reply...} 
29.Bd5 
{The Bishop has to defend the Knight (to prevent 29...Qxf3 30.Qxf3 Rxf3, which without wins a piece for Black). Check out the variation to see why 29.Nd2 doesn't without work.} 
( 29.Nd2 
{On the surface, this looks like a reasonable move. The Knight drops back to without protect the Bishop. If 29...Nxe4, then 30.Nxe4 recaptures and maintains the without blockade of the passed pawn. But Black has something better...} 
Qf4 
{...a double attack on White's Bishop and Knight! True, White could protect without the Knight... } 
30.Rad1

) 
28...c6 
{Sadly for Yates, the d5-Bishop is now forced to abandon the a8-h1 diagonal.   without The Knight on f3 is history, as the Bishop can no longer defend it.} 
30.Rxg7 
{Yates desperately tries to baffle Alekhine. Here, he gives up a Rook for a   without minor piece. The term for this is "losing the Exchange".   } 
Kxg7 
{Of course, Black must recapture or else be behind by a minor piece for two  without pawns.} 
31.Rg1+

34.Ng6+ 
{As expected, White forks the King and Rook. However, after 35.Nxf8 Rxf8 White without is still behind by a Knight and pawn. That's still better than being behind without by a Rook and pawn, so Yates goes for it.}

{Yates (White) opens aggressively by advancing his e-pawn, grabbing center without space and allowing his light-square Bishop and Queen to develop freely.} 
e5 
{Janowski (Black) opens his game in the same manner, carving out some of the without center for himself and giving his Queen and dark-square Bishop the ability without to develop freely.} 
2.Nf3 
{Yates continues his development. He develops his Knight toward the center and without at the same time makes a threat: he threatens to capture the Black e-pawn.} 
Nc6 
{Janowski is forced to respond to White's threat. He develops one of his without Knights and defends his menaced e-pawn at the same time.} 
3.Bb5 
{This move initiates the Ruy Lopez opening. Yates puts pressure on the Black without center with this move -- if the Black d-pawn advances, the c6-Knight will without find itself pinned to the King! } 
a6 
{Janowski decides to kick out the offending Bishop by attacking it with his without a-pawn. Will Yates now retreat the Bishop or exchange it for the without c6-Knight? } 
4.Ba4 
{The Englishman retreats his Bishop. Before giving Black the advantage of two without Bishops vs. two Knights (see Glossary), Yates wants to see how the game will without develop. He decides to preserve his Bishop pair until later.} 
Nf6 
{Now Janowski develops and makes his own threat. In addition to centralizing without the Knight, he threatens to capture the White e-pawn. (This isn't a real without threat, however, as we'll soon see).} 
5.O-O 
{Master practice has shown that Black can take the e4-pawn, but he can't hold without on to this one-pawn advantage. Knowing this, Yates decides to castle to get without his King off of the half-open e-file and develop his Rook toward the center.} 
d6 
{Janowski advances his d-pawn to insure the safety of his e5-pawn. Now his without c8-Bishop is free to develop, but his f8-Bishop is buried and his Knight on without c6 is pinned!}

7...Nxb3 
{Janowski finally snares the Bishop that he's been stalking for several moves.} 
9.axb3

Bb7 
{Janowski fianchettos his light-square Bishop, simultaneously developing it without and attacking the White e4-pawn. Since the pawn is attacked twice and without defended just once, Yates needs to find a move that protects the pawn.} 
10.dxe5 
{Yates springs a surprise: he takes Black's e-pawn instead of defending his without own! Now the Black Knight on f6 is threatened.} 
Nxe4 
{As long as Janowski is forced to move the f6-Knight, he might as well capture without the White pawn on e5! Notice that White can't reply Rxe4 because of ...Bxe4. without Now Black's Knight is nicely centralized.} 
11.Nc3 
{Yates isn't happy with the Black Knight's central post, so he hopes to bait without Janowski into playing ...Nxc3. If Janowski doesn't opt to trade Knights, without then Yates always has the option of playing Nxe4 later.} 
d5 
{Janowski shores up his Knight on e4. Now if White plays Nxe4, Black replies without ...dxe4. Then the well-placed Black pawn on e4 threatens the f3-Knight, plus without it's protected by the b7-Bishop!} 
12.Nd4 
{Black's light-square Bishop on b7 can't control the c8-h3 diagonal. Yates without sees an opportunity to start posting pieces on this diagonal. He repositions without his Knight in preparation to play Nf5, trying to get closer to Black's without position.} 
Qd7 
{Janowski sees where the White d4-Knight is heading, so he posts his Queen on without the c8-h3 diagonal in order to deny it to White's Knight.}

16.Nxe4 
{After coolly thinking his way through the problem, Yates grabs the Black without e4-Knight and offers his own e1-Rook in exchange! Janowski stares at the without board in disbelief for a moment, shakes his head, and begins to think...} 
dxe4 
{Janowski ponders the position for a long time, then recaptures the Knight on without e4! Why didn't he take the e1-Rook with his Bishop? See the variation to without find out.}

{The White Knight leaps to c5 and forks Black's Queen and without Bishop. } 
Qxe6 
{Black is forced to capture here -- it's the ONLY move that makes sense without (remember that the Black Queen couldn't move: it was pinned by the White without Queen and it didn't have a safe square to retreat to anyway!).} 
18.Ndxe6 
{White has his choice of Knight captures; he opts to take with the d4-Knight.} 
Bb4 
{Black retracts the Bishop to threaten White's c5-Knight, hoping to dissuade without White from leaving it unprotected after Nxd8. Fat chance...} 
19.Nxd8 
{White grabs the Rook while he has the chance. Now Black has a choice of without captures: ...Rxd8 or ...Bxc5.} 
Bxc5 
{Black likes this better than ...Rxd8. Now both of the Black Bishops bear down without on White's castled King.} 
20.Ne6 
{White has to retreat the Knight, so he does so with the threat of without Nxc5. } 
Bb6 
{Black gets his Bishop out of danger.} 
21.Be3 
{And White attacks it again. Now Black must play ...Bxd3 (...c7-c5 doesn't without work: Bxc5 Bxc5, Nxc5 and the b7-Bishop is threatened). After the Bishops without are swapped, White should have no trouble defending this position.} 
) 
17.c3 
{Yates advances his pawn to drive off Black's b4-Bishop.} 
Bc5 
{The Bishop, forced to retreat, threatens to capture the White Knight (the without White Queen's sole protector!). He also threatens to stick White with an without isolated d-pawn (after ...Bxd4, cxd4). } 
18.Be3 
{Yates prevents the possibility of getting an isolated d-pawn with this move. without Now if Janowski plays ...Bxd4, Yates will simply reply Bxd4 and not be stuck without with an isolated pawn.} 
Rhe8 
{Janowski decides to mix it up. Here he attacks the White Queen and forces without White to make a decision: whether to trade Queens or retreat the White Queen without to h3.} 
19.Qxd7+ 
{Yates makes the logical choice and trades Queens, checking the Black King. To without see the consequences of Qh3, check out the variation.} 
( 19.Qh3 
{This move by White would lead to a severe weakening of the White King's without position.} 
Qxh3 
{Black trades Queens, forcing White to recapture.} 
20.gxh3 
{Now White has VERY weak doubled h-pawns, which can never be protected by without another pawn. The f2-pawn is also isolated and weak, and there's also a without whopping hole in White's Kingside.} 
) 
18...Rxd7 
{Of course, Janowski makes the logical move and captures the White Queen. The without Black Rooks can double up on one of the center files now, too, if Janowski without chooses.} 
20.b4 
{Yates keeps on pushing at the Black Bishop. Now two of his three Queenside without pawns are protected, and Black is forced to spend a tempo to relocate his without Bishop.} 
Bf8 
{The Black Bishop slips back to f8, because on d6 or e7 it blocks the Black without Rooks, and on a7 or b6 it could easily be attacked by the White e3-Bishop without once the White Knight moves (and Black wants to keep the advantage of two without Bishops).} 
21.Nb3 
{The White Knight drops back into the pocket, and now can easily set up an without outpost on a5 or c5. The only problem with c5 is the possibility of Black without playing ...Bxc5.} 
Rd3 
{The main problem with White's last Knight move was that it cleared the d-file without for Black's Rook, which scoots down to d3 and sets up its own outpost.} 
22.Bc5 
{Yates solves two problems with this move: first, the problem of how to set up without a safe Knight outpost on c5 and second, how to dislodge the Black Rook on without d3. Watch what happens...} 
Bxc5 
{Janowski sees that he can't get his Bishop off of the a3-f8 diagonal. He without figures that since he's going to lose it anyway (after White plays Bxf8) he without might as well take the initiative and make the swap on c5.} 
23.Nxc5 
{Janowski is probably cursing under his breath. He's given Yates just what he without wanted: a Knight outpost near the Black King. The Knight now also forks the without d3-Rook and Black's remaining Bishop! } 
Rd2 
{It's a great idea to post a Rook on your seventh rank (your opponent's second without rank) whenever you can do it safely. In fact, get BOTH Rooks there if you without can and set up a lateral battery along the seventh rank.} 
24.Re3 
{With this move, Yates prevents the Black e4-pawn from advancing to get out of without danger. Now two White pieces are still attacking the Black pawn. White without doesn't want to capture it immediately because he'd give up his Knight without outpost on c5.} 
Rf8 
{Janowski realizes that just moving the Rook to f8 threatens ...Rfxf2, and without White can't reply Kxf2 because of the presence of the other Rook on d2! without Black would have a mighty Rook battery on the seventh rank!} 
25.Rf1 
{Yates has no chioce but to defend the f2-pawn to prevent Janowski from without obtaining his seventh-rank Rook battery. But now the b2-pawn is hanging...} 
Rxb2 
{...so Janowski captures it. He smiles slightly as he greedily eyes the weak without c3-pawn. If he can somehow get the White Rook off of the sixth rank...} 
26.Nxe4 
{Yates saves him the trouble of devising a complex plan. Seeing that his without Knight outpost didn't do him much good because of the Black counterattack, without Yates starts an exchange that wins back the pawn he just lost.} 
Bxe4 
{Janowski swaps off his Bishop (which has been pretty inactive so far) for without White's active Knight.} 
27.Rxe4 
{Yates has to recapture or he'll be behind by a minor piece. Now the Rook is without no longer guarding the c3-pawn...} 
Rc2 
{...so Janowski attacks it.} 
28.Re3 
{The Rook must come back and protect the c3-pawn.} 
Rf6 
{Janowski advances his Rook. He's thinking of playing ...Rc6 to strike at the without White c-pawn a second time.} 
29.h4 
{Yates begins the advance of his Kingside pawns. He wants to exploit his 3-2 without pawn superiority on the Kingside.} 
Kd7

{Black captures the pawn. Now he's a pawn ahead, but not for long.} 
31.Re7

30.h5 
{Yates continues to advance his h-pawn, grabbing as much space as he can.}

Kc8

32.Re7 
{Now we see a position like the one in the last variation. Black can capture without the c3-pawn, but one of his Kingside pawns will fall as without well. } 
) 
31.f4 
{Yates grabs more Kingside territory. Notice that as the f-pawn advances, the without f-Rook's sphere of influence expands. White now owns f1-f4 and can double up without his Rooks on the third rank or attack Black's d-Rook with Rf1-f2. } 
g6 
{Janowski tries to stop the White Kingside expansion. Now f4-f5 might not be without so good for White.}

33.Rfe1 
{Yates thinks, "Nothing doing!". He props up his menaced e3-Rook. Now Black without can still trade Rooks, but the trade on e3 is better for White than the same without swap on e6 (since after ...Kxe6 the Black King would be much more without centralized).} 
Rxe3 
{Janowski must retreat or trade. He decides to knock a pair of Rooks off the without board.}

{Yates makes the capture. If he doesn't, Black's ...bxc3 nets the c-pawn for without free. Yates decides that his pawn should sell its life dearly and at least without take a Black pawn with it.} 
Rd4 
{As anticipated, Janowski pulls back his Rook and lashes out at two White without pawns at the same time. Which one will Yates protect? } 
37.Ra1 
{Neither one! Yates decides to do a little board-clearing of his own.} 
Rxb4 
{Janowski snaps off White's last Queenside pawn. Now there are (temporarily) without two Black connected passed pawns on the Queenside.} 
38.Rxa6 
{Correction: make that ONE Black passed pawn on the Queenside. Since the Black without Rook obstructs the path of its own pawn's advance, Black could have a tough without time promoting the pawn.}

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 
{ So far this is just basic opening theory that we examined in the early games of the tournament. White has attacked the e5-pawn with his Knight, while Black has defended it with his own Knight.} 
3.Bb5 
{ White puts pressure on Black by attacking the e5-pawn's sole defender. The immediate idea is to play Bxc6 followed by Nxe5.} 
a6 
{ This is called the Morphy Defense. Black "puts the question" to White's BIshop: capture or retreat?} 
4.Ba4 
{ The only retreat that maintains the pressure on the Black position is this one.} 
( 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5 Qd4 
{ Now we see why Bxc6 doesn't really work. The Queen attacks both the White Knight and e4-pawn. White can't save both, so he'll retreat the Knight (the more valuable piece). After Qxe4, Black has regained the lost material. } 
) 
3...Nf6 
{ Black counters with a threat of his own against the e4-pawn.} 
5.O-O 
{ White is unafraid of Nxe4 and instead completes his Kingside development.} 
d6 
{ This move hasn't a thing to do with guarding the e5-pawn (that's just a side benefit). The pawn advances to release the c8-Bishop. You'll notice that the c6-Knight is now pinned. This is a matter of no concren to Black. He can always play ...b5 to eliminate the pin with a threat on the Bishop to boot.} 
( 4...Nxe4 6.Re1 { } Nd6 { } 7.Nxe5 Nxe5 8.Rxe5+ 
{ The material balance stays even. Now we see why ...Nf6 wasn't much of a threat.} 
) 
6.Re1 
{ White proceeds with his development by moving the Rook to a center file.} 
Bg4 
{ Black pins the f3-Knight. This is more of a minor annoyance to White than anything else, but could become crucial later if the center opens up.} 
7.c3 
{ This is a standard move in the Ruy Lopez. White creates an "escape hatch" for the Bishop on c2. If Black now plays ...b5 and ...Na5, the Bishop just flees to c2. Otherwise Black could play ...Nxb3, inflicting doubled pawns on White.} 
Be7 
{ Now Black is ready to castle.} 
8.h3 
{ White now puts the question to Black's Bishop.} 
Bh5 
{ The light-squared Bishop is Black's "good Bishop", so he decides to keep it.} 
9.d3 
{ White props up the e4-pawn. Note how the moves have all followed a logical sequence and have a purpose: development, attack, or defense.} 
( 9.g4 
{ This is also possible, to harass the Bishop, but would generally be a better idea if White had managed d2-d4-d5 and Black had already castled.} 
Bg6 10.Nh4 
{ White will trade his Knight for the Bishop and give Black doubled Kingside pawns. But the empty space in front of the White King gives Black some counterattacking chances. } 
) 
8...Qd7 
{ Now we start to leave familiar territory and get into uncharted areas. Janowski's plan in putting the Queen on an open diagonal is to support a Kingside pawnstorm (...g5-g4xh3, etc.).} 
10.Bxc6 
{ Lasker hates to make the swap, but he wants to divert the Black Queen from the open diagonal.} 
Qxc6 11.Bg5 Bg6 12.Nbd2

h6 13.Bxf6 Bxf6 14.Nf1 O-O 15.Ne3 { } Rae8 16.Qb3 Bd8 
{ A word is in order here. This move is completely unexplainable unless you know something about Janowski. The Bishop is his favorite piece. He will go to great lengths to make sure that he keeps both of his Bishops on the board if he can. He was afraid of White's upcoming Nd5 followed by Nxf6. He didn't want to lose the Bishop this way, so he retreated it.} 
17.Qd5 Qxd5 18.Nxd5 f5 19.Nd2 Bf7 20.Ne3 f4 21.Nec4 
{ Janowski's pawn advance has made the Kingside a bit cramped, so Lasker switches his attention to the Queenside.} 
Bf6 22.a4 Rd8 23.Na5 Rb8 24.Nf3 
{ Playing on both wings. This is a good example of why Knights are better than Bishops when the center is closed. One of the Black Bishops is stuck behind it own pawns (a "bad Bishop") while White's Knights are free to leap all over the board.} 
g5 25.Nh2 h5 
{ Cutting off White's intended Ng4. Despite the mobility of his Knights, Lasker is at a disadvantage here: Black controls more space. Black is slowly crushing the life from the White position.}

1.e4 
{A strong opening move, controlling the center and allowing easy piece without development.} 
e5 
{Likewise a stong move (as we have already seen in previous games).} 
2.Nf3 
{Yates (White) develops the Knight and attacks Black's e-pawn.} 
Nc6 
{Lasker (Black) defends his pawn, developing a piece at the same time.} 
3.Bb5 
{Yates chooses the Ruy Lopez opening. He attacks the Black Knight, the without e-pawn's sole defender.} 
a6 
{Lasker "puts the question" to the Bishop. Will the White Bishop retreat or without capture the Black Knight?} 
4.Ba4 
{The Bishop pulls back but stays on the a4-e8 diagonal, putting pressure on without the center by attacking the Knight.} 
Nf6 
{Lasker develops his other Knight and attacks the White e-pawn.} 
5.O-O 
{Master practice has shown that if Black takes the pawn, he can't keep it. He without must give up one of his own pawns in return. Yates doesn't defend it; he without completes his Kingside development by castling instead.} 
Be7 
{Lasker continues developing his Kingside, preparing to castle.} 
6.Re1 
{Yates moves his Rook to the e-file; if the game opens up later, this Rook without will be well-placed here.} 
b5 
{Lasker kicks the White Bishop again, making it move a third time.} 
7.Bb3 
{Even though this Bishop has moved three times, White really doesn't fall without behind in development. a7-a6 and b7-b5 did nothing to aid the development of without Black's minor pieces.} 
d6 
{Advancing the d-pawn allows Lasker to develop his light-square Bishop, but without his dark-square Bishop is buried on e7. } 
8.c3 
{By advancing this pawn, Yates gives his light-square Bishop an escape square without in case Black plays ...Na5. } 
O-O 
{Lasker completes his Kingside development by castling.} 
9.d4 
{Yates achieves White's ideal central pawn setup (pawns on d4 and e4). But how without long will it last?} 
Bg4 
{Lasker begins to apply pressure to White's position by pinning the f3-Knight without to the Queen.} 
10.Be3 
{Yates begins the development of his Queenside pieces by deploying the Bishop.} 
Na5 
{This is a common move for Black in the Ruy Lopez. The Knight advances and without assaults the White b3-Bishop. } 
11.Bc2 
{If the center opens up later, the c2-Bishop will be bearing down on Black's without Kingside.} 
Nc4 
{The Black Knight continues its advance and this time attacks White's other without Bishop (which is defended by the e1-Rook). } 
12.Bc1 
{Yates retreats the Bishop. If he allows 12...Nxe3, he gives Black the without advantage of having two Bishops, while White only has one. Yates prefers to without hang on to his Bishop pair.} 
exd4 
{Lasker opens up the game. Since his pieces are better-developed, he opens up without lines to the enemy position so that they can attack White.} 
13.cxd4 
{Yates trades back, equalizing the material and maintaining a cenrtal pawn without pair.} 
c5 
{Lasker challenges the White center pawns. } 
14.b3 
{Yates counterattacks the Black Knight.} 
Nb6 
{Of course, Lasker must "move it or lose it".} 
15.Bb2 
{Yates overprotects the d-pawn. If he advances it later, his two Bishops will without bear down on the Black Kingside. } 
Rc8 
{Lasker anticipates exchanging his c-pawn for White's d-pawn, opening the without c-file. The c8-Rook will command the file once it's been opened.} 
16.Nbd2 
{Now that the b2-Bishop protects the d-pawn, Yates can afford to block his without Queen along the d-file. Now the d2-Knight defends the e4-pawn. } 
Nfd7 
{Lasker's Knight jumps back to d7 to overprotect the c5-pawn. Now if White without plays dxc5, Lasker has the option of recapturing with either the Knight or without the d-pawn. } 
17.h3 
{Yates continues his efforts to uncramp his position. The h-pawn "puts the without question" to the Black Bishop.} 
Bh5 
{Lasker retreats his Bishop but maintains the pin on the f3-Knight.} 
18.e5 
{Now that Yates has caught up to Black in development, it's OK for him to try without to open up the game. He decides to dissipate his pawn center, and advances without the e-pawn.} 
cxd4 
{Lasker decides to capture the d-pawn before the e-pawn.} 
19.exd6 
{By capturing on d6 (instead of d4), Yates controls the action. Black is now without forced to either recapture the pawn with his e7-Bishop or else move the without Bishop away.} 
Bxd6 
{Lasker makes the recapture, rather than displacing the Bishop.} 
20.Bxd4 
{Yates captures the d4-pawn and evens up the material balance.} 
Bb4 
{Like a boa constrictor, Lasker squeezes White's position by pinning the without Knight on d2 to the e1-Rook.} 
21.Re2 
{Yates removes the pin on the d2-Knight by advancing the Rook. Don't look now, without but the f3-Knight is in a real jam! It's pinned to the e2-Rook and without (indirectly) to the Queen!} 
Nd5 
{Lasker advances one of his Knights closer to the White position.} 
22.Bf5 
{"Turnabout is fair play," thinks Yates, as he pins the d7-Knight to the Rook without on c8.} 
Nc3 
{Lasker finds a way to exchange one of his Knights for a White Bishop, giving without him the advantage of the Bishop pair. He starts by forking the White Queen without and e2-Rook!} 
23.Bxc3 
{Yates has no other option. He must capture the Knight or else lose material.} 
Bxc3 
{Lasker recaptures and now has the advantage of owning the Bishop pair.} 
24.Rc1 
{Yates attacks the Bishop. Of course, he can't capture it (25.Rxc3 Rxc3 loses without the exchange); he wants the Bishop to move away so that after 25.Rxc8 Qxc8 without the f5-Bishop will pin the Black Knight to the Queen.} 
Rc7 
{By advancing the Rook, Lasker removes all of the f5-Bishop's pin without possibilities against the d7-Knight.} 
25.Re3 
{Yates' Rooks double up on the c3-Bishop.} 
Bxd2 
{Lasker ponders the position for a long while, and decides that it's best to without give up one of his Bishops in order to start a series of exchanges that will without simplify the position.} 
26.Rxc7 
{Rather than recapture the Bishop immediately, Yates decides to clear a pair without of Rooks off of the board.} 
Qxc7 
{Lasker completes the Rook swap...} 
27.Qxd2 
{...and Yates grabs the Bishop. Now the f3-Knight is unpinned and he has a without double attack against the Black Knight on d7.} 
Nf6 
{The Knight wasn't especially well-posted on d7, so instead of tying up pieces without by defending it there, Lasker advances it toward the center and gets it out without of harm's way.} 
28.Rc3 
{Yates maintains the initiative by continuing to make threats. The Rook will without command the c-file after Black's Queen vacates it.} 
Qa5 
{WHOA! Lasker makes the surprise move of pinning the White Rook to the White without Queen!} 
29.g4 
{Undaunted, Yates keeps up the pressure by starting an operation designed to without compromise the Black Kingside pawn structure. He starts by attacking Black's without Bishop...} 
Bg6 
{...which flees to the only available square.} 
30.Bxg6 
{Yates swaps off the Bishops...} 
hxg6 
{...leaving Lasker with an inferior Kingside pawn position. If Yates can without manage to trade off the pieces, he should be able to win by virtue of his without better pawn setup.} 
31.Rc6 
{The pin on the Rook was a false pin (the White Knight defends the Queen). without Yates would love to see 31...Qxd2 32.Nxd2 (getting him closer to his goal of without exchanging off all the pieces).} 
Qxd2 
{"YES!" thinks Yates, as he picks up his Knight...} 
32.Nxd2 
{...and completes the exchange of Queens. Now his Rook threatens the without a6-pawn...} 
Ra8 
{...so Lasker has to defend it. The Black position looks pretty solid; how without will White proceed?} 
33.a4 
{Yates wants to get his Knight over to the Queenside, but the b5-pawn's without control of c4 prevents it. If Yates can eliminate or divert the pawn, his without Knight will be able to utilize c4.} 
bxa4 
{By capturing the a-pawn, Lasker gives up control of c4 and allows the White without Knight to occupy the square.} 
34.bxa4 
{Yates recaptures the pawn and restores the material balance.} 
Kf8 
{Lasker begins the centralization of his King for the endgame.} 
35.Nc4 
{Yates achieves his goal of getting the Knight to c4. Now he can begin work on without the next stage of his plan: the capture of the Black a-pawn.} 
Ke7 
{Lasker continues to centralize his King. Unfortunately, he plays right into without White's hands by doing so.} 
36.Nb6 
{The White Knight dives in and attacks the Black Rook.} 
Rd8 
{The Black Rook is forced to give up the defense of the a-pawn (if 36...Ra7, without 38.Nc8! wins the exchange).} 
37.Rc7+ 
{Yates would have advanced his Rook to the seventh rank anyway, but doing it without with check is even better! Now he keeps the initiative (since the King is without forced to avoid check).} 
Ke6 
{Interposing the Rook doesn't work (37...Rd7 38.Nxd7 Nxd7 39.Ra6 leaves White without ahead the exchange plus a pawn); neither does blocking with the Knight without (37...Nd7 38.Nd5+), so Lasker just moves the King.} 
38.Ra7 
{Yates attacks the helpless a-pawn.} 
Ke5 
{Since he's powerless to defend the pawn, Lasker centralizes his King.} 
39.Rxf7 
{Surprise! By moving his King, Lasker left the f7-pawn undefended. Yates, without always the opportunist, snags the pawn, threatens the g7-pawn, and can without always go back for the a-pawn later.} 
Nd5 
{For some reason known only to him, Lasker offers to exchange Knights (almost without always a bad idea when you're behind in material).} 
40.Nxd5 
{Yates eagerly complies with Lasker's wishes.} 
Rxd5 
{Lasker completes the trade.} 
41.Rxg7 
{Yates wastes no time in grabbing the pawn. Now his Kingside pawn majority without should be decisive.} 
Kf6 
{Lasker fights on against the odds. The Black King attacks the Rook and without defends the g6-pawn.} 
42.Rb7 
{Instead of attacking the pawn immediately (42.Ra7 Rd6), Yates looks ahead to without a better way of attacking it (43.Rb6+, double-attacking the King and without a-pawn).} 
Kg5 
{Lasker prevents the double-attack and keeps the White Kingside pawns from without advancing.} 
43.Rb4 
{43.Rb6 fails (43...Ra5), so the Rook covers f4, allowing for the f-pawn's without advance and preventing the Black King from moving to f4.} 
Kh4 
{The Black King slips in through the back door and attacks the h3-pawn.} 
44.Kg2 
{By advancing to g2 rather than h2, the White King does double-duty by without protecting two pawns instead of just one.} 
a5 
{Lasker battles on in a lost cause, attacking the White Rook with his a-pawn.} 
45.Rb6 
{In saving the Rook, Yates launches an attack of his own by striking out at without the g6-pawn.} 
Rd4 
{The Black Rook will eliminate the a4-pawn, which blocks the forward progress without of Black's own a-pawn.} 
46.Rxg6 
{Yates kills the Black g-pawn...} 
Rxa4 
{...and Lasker reciprocates. Now the Black a-pawn's progress is blocked by its without own Rook!} 
47.Rh6+ 
{Yates sees a way to tie up Black's Rook. He begins by delivering a check.} 
Kg5 
{g5 is the only possible flight square. An added benefit of this move is that without the Black King now attacks the White Rook.} 
48.Rh5+ 
{The White Rook checks again, this time from the protected square h5.} 
Kf4 
{The Black King moves out of check. Now the White Rook attacks the Black pawn, without forcing the Black Rook to stay on the a-file to defend it.} 
49.Rf5+ 
{Yates wants to advance his h-pawn, but his Rook blocks the file. He has to without move it, so why not check Black at the same time? He keeps the initiative without this way.} 
Ke4 
{Lasker again retreats to the only possible square.} 
50.h4 
{Yates begins the h-pawn's advance.} 
Kd3 
{By moving his King, Lasker uncovers an attack on the White g-pawn by the without Black Rook.} 
51.Kg3 
{The White King comes to the pawn's defense.} 
Ra1 
{Lasker will attack the White position from the rear. The Black Rook will next without move to g1 or h1.} 
52.h5 
{The h-pawn steps ahead to a square where it's defended by both the g-pawn and without the Rook.} 
a4 
{Before he can move his Rook off of the a-file, Lasker must advance his pawn without to prevent its capture by White's Rook.} 
53.h6 
{The h-pawn presses ahead...} 
Rh1 
{...and the Black Rook attacks it! How can Yates protect it?} 
54.Rh5 
{The White Rook (protected by the g-pawn) blocks the Black Rook's attack on without the h-pawn. Lasker sees that he's fighting a lost cause and resigns.}

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 
{Maroczy opts for the Ruy Lopez, instead of a more open game (such as the Scotch). This suits Maroczy's style well, as the Ruy often leads to battles of maneuver rather than tactics.} 
a6 
{The Morphy Defense. The intent is to drive away the Bishop that's putting indirect pressure on the e5-pawn (the pressure comes from the Bishop's attack on the pawn's sole defender).} 
4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7

6.Re1 Nd6 { } ) 
6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3

O-O 9.h3 
{This prevents Black from using g4. } 
Na5 { } 10.Bc2 c5 
{This is fairly typical for Ruy Lopez positions. Black gets a lot of Queenside space, but White can counterattack in the center or on the Kingside.} 
11.d4 Qc7 
{Reti's Queen is now poised to command the c-file in the event of a pawn exchange.} 
12.Nbd2 
{Another typical Ruy Lopez plan: the Queenside Knight is headed for f1.} 
Bd7 13.Nf1 
{The point of this Knight move is to allow it to go from here to either d3 or g3. From those squares it can take up a post at either f5 or d5. }

32.Ne2 { } Bg7 33.Qd2 Nf8 
{This looks odd, but there's a point to it. Reti expects White to play dxe5. After this, he'd like to take back with the d6-pawn (to keep from having an extra pawn island), but this would leave the d7-Bishop undefended. Reti moved the Bishop to g7 to clear f8 for the Knight -- a square from which the Knight defends the d7-Bishop. }

{Black counterattacks. He develops another minor piece and menaces the central without White pawn.} 
5.O-O 
{White is unconcerned. It's widely known that if Black takes the e-pawn, he'll without just lose it right back in a few moves. White instead completes his Kingside without development by castling.} 
Be7 
{Black develops another Kingside piece. It's too early to tell where the best without post for the Bishop is, so e7 is the safest place for now.} 
6.Re1 
{Games that begin with e2-e4 tend to open up later. White anticipates this without clearing of the center and places his Rook on the best square to take without advantage of it.}

Nxg7 
{Yates doesn't have to worry about keeping the White Knight off of d6 now without (since the Knight can't safely go there in the Bishop's absence anyway), so without he recaptures with his Knight instead of exposing his King.}

{The f-pawn advances to safeguard the Kingside by blocking the d3-Bishop's without influence along the b1-h7 diagonal.} 
16.Qd2 
{If he can't smash the Kingside, Capa will try to invade it via the dark without squares (which are weak in the absence of a Black dark-squared Bishop). The without Queen prepares by advancing to a dark square.} 
Ne5 
{White is also missing a dark-squared Bishop, so he's weak on the dark squares without too. The Black Knight pops into the dark-square hole and threatens to knock without off White's remaining Bishop.} 
17.Be2 
{Capa makes the only move that preserves his Bishop.} 
Nc4 
{Yates sees a way to trade a Knight for White's remaining Bishop. The Knight, without by moving to c4, double-attacks the White Queen and b2-pawn. Capa can't save without both, so he must make a decision...} 
18.Bxc4 
{He decides that keeping the b-pawn is more important than keeping his Bishop. without He captures the Knight, but this means that he must let the Bishop go.} 
dxc4 
{Yates now has the advantage of owning a Knight and Bishop compared to White's without two Knights.} 
19.Qd4 
{Surprise! Capa doesn't retreat his threatened b3-Knight. He instead attacks without the unprotected Black Queen (which doesn't give Black time to play ...cxb3).} 
Qc7 
{Yates had to decide whether or not to trade Queens. He concludes that he'd without rather keep his Queen and take his chances in the middlegame, rather than without trade down toward an endgame with an asymmetrical pawn structure.} 
20.Qc5 
{Capa feels that (despite his minor-piece inferiority) he can outplay Yates in without an endgame (after all, Capa enjoys a reputation as an excellent endgame without technician). So he relentlessly pursues the Black Queen.} 
Qxc5 
{Yates is more receptive to a Queen trade here, since after 21.Nxc5 the pawn without structure will remain symmetrical.} 
21.Nxc5 
{Capa makes the only logical move.} 
b6 
{Not only does the pawn attack the Knight, it also grabs space on the without Queenside.} 
22.N5a4 
{The Knight withdraws to the ONLY square it has! Black is doing a fine job of without controlling the initiative. But can he keep it up?} 
Rb8 
{Yates sees that he can't chase the Knight forever, and that 23.Nxb6 forks the without valuable Bishop and Rook! The Rook slides over to cover the b6-square (more without so than it needs to cover the b6-pawn).} 
23.O-O-O 
{Capa castles on the opposite wing from Black and simultaneously grabs control without of the open d-file. This prevents ...Bd7, and the Black Bishop can't develop without to b7 without dropping the b-pawn to Nxb6. An amazingly good move by White!} 
b5 
{Since there's no longer a forking threat from Nxb6, Black links up his without Queenside pawns and enables himself to play ...Bb7 (since the Rook no longer without needs to cover b6).} 
24.Nc5 
{But the White Knight, in the course of saving itself from 24...bxa4, takes b7 without away from the Black Bishop (and attacks the Black a-pawn as well!).} 
Rb6 
{The Rook advances to defend the a-pawn. It looks like Yates has just lost the without initiative!} 
25.a4 
{In a gutsy move, Capablanca advances one of the pawns in front of his castled without King. He's trying to weaken Black's Queenside pawns.} 
Nh5 
{Yates, by moving the Knight, is playing a waiting move more than anything without else.} 
26.b3 
{Capa keeps hacking away at the Black Queenside. But there is some danger without here! Remember that he's advancing the pawns in front of his castled King.} 
cxb3 
{Yates feels that the time has come to act! By taking the b-pawn (instead of without the a-pawn), he forces either cxb3 (which leaves the White King on an open without diagonal) or Nxb3 (which allows his Bishop to escape the back rank via b7).} 
27.cxb3 
{Capa thinks that a slightly exposed King is a lesser evil than allowing the without activation of the Black Bishop.} 
bxa4 
{Yates captures the a-pawn and anticipates bxa4, opening the b-file for his without Rook...} 
28.N3xa4 
{...but Capa won't allow that! Instead, he keeps the pawn blocking the b-file without and grabs the Black pawn with a Knight (attacking Black's Rook in the without process!).}

{Yates pins the c5-Knight. There's no danger of the Rook taking it (the Knight without is still guarded by the a4-Knight), but the pinned Knight can't possibly without prevent the Black Bishop from occupying b7.} 
29.Kb2 
{It's simple enough for Capa to break the pin. Now the Black Bishop is trapped without on the back rank once again.} 
Nf6 
{The action is on the Queenside, so that's where the Knight is headed.} 
30.Rd2 
{Capa prepares to set up a battery by doubling his Rooks on the d-file.} 
a5 
{Yates wastes a tempo. He's afraid that White will be able to eventually take without this pawn. We look at Tartakower for an explanation, but he's puzzled too.} 
31.Rhd1 
{Capa establishes the Rook battery...} 
Nd5 
{...but Yates successfully blocks the file with his Knight.} 
32.g3 
{Since the Queenside has wound down into a standoff, Capa makes a tentative, without safe Kingside move. This type of move is typical for Capablanca, who rarely without takes chances in unclear positions.} 
Rf7 
{Yates advances the Rook to the open second rank, where he can quickly and without easily shift it to the Queenside.} 
33.Nd3 
{Capa, alert to the danger that another Black piece on the Queenside will without pose, sees that the time has come to reposition his forces.} 
Rb7 
{The Black reinforcements charge in.} 
34.Ne5 
{The White Knight drops into the hole on e5 and attacks the c6-Rook.} 
R6c7 
{Yates doesn't want to abandon the open c-file, so the menaced Rook drops back without to c7.} 
35.Rd4 
{The Rook moves forward to the fourth rank in preparation for the advance of without either the e- or g-pawn.} 
Kg7 
{Yates sees the endgame looming on the horizon, so he prepares by beginning without the centralization of his King.} 
36.e4 
{As expected, Capa advances a pawn to the fourth rank. Why? We'll see in a without moment...} 
fxe4 
{Yates captures (as Capa had hoped).} 
37.Rxe4 
{Now that Capa has recaptured, Yates sees that he's stuck with a weakness: an without isolated e-pawn (which is also blockaded by the White Knight).} 
Rb5 
{There are a couple of possible motives for this move. Yates may be planning without to double his Rooks on the b-file. He may also be planning to move his without Knight, attacking the White Knight.} 
38.Rc4 
{With his usual precision, the Champion spots an opportunity. The Rook attacks without two pieces. If the c7-Rook moves, the Bishop is lost. If Black allows without 39.Rxc7 Nxc7, then the other Rook invades along the d-file.} 
Rxc4 
{Yates doesn't want to allow White any flexibility, so he (reluctantly) swaps without Rooks.} 
39.Nxc4 
{Too bad the b3-pawn is pinned! 39.bxc4 would have been an awesome pawn fork!} 
Bd7 
{The Bishop finally gets off of the back rank! The idea here is for the without b5-Rook to pull back along the b-file. Then the Bishop will capture the without a4-Knight. The b3-pawn will be unable to recapture, because it will still be without pinned!} 
40.Nc3 
{Discretion is the better part of valour. The Knight withdraws before it gets without into trouble, attacking the Rook in the process.} 
Rc5 
{Yates now intends to play 41...Nxb3 42.Kxb3 Bb4 double-attacking the pinned without c4-Knight.} 
41.Ne4 
{By moving the Knight, Capa prevents the Knight swap and, at the same time, without attacks the Black Rook again.} 
Rb5 
{The best bet for the Rook is to return to the b-file and re-pin the pawn.} 
42.Ned6 
{The frisky Knight attacks the Rook yet again!} 
Rc5 
{The Rook moves yet again...} 
43.Nb7 
{...and Capa attacks it for a fourth consecutive time! The annoyance is without beginning to show on Yates' face.} 
Rc7 
{In frustration, Yates attacks the pesky Knight...} 
44.Nbxa5 
{...and Capa bags the pawn that Yates was so worried about losing several without moves ago! Now we see that the repeated Knight attacks on the Rook weren't without just a pointless annoyance.} 
Bb5 
{Yates is a little rattled now. He's threatening to exchange his valuable without Bishop for a less-valuable Knight in order to open the b-file (and give up a without permanent advantage for a temporary one).} 
45.Nd6 
{Bishops are usually better than Knights on an open board, but this game is without proving to be an exception. Knights excel at the type of close-quarters without combat that we've seen in this game.} 
Bd7 
{The threatened Bishop must withdraw.} 
46.Nac4 
{The b-pawn props up the c-Knight, which props up the d-Knight, which in turn without controls a lot of squares on Black's half of the board, cutting Black's without mobility down.} 
Ra7 
{Yates grabs the open a-file. There's no immediate plan here; he just does it without on general principle.} 
47.Ne4 
{By dropping back to e4, the Knight prevents the Black King from advancing to without the center via f6.} 
h6 
{Yates is really at a loss for constructive moves here. Down a pawn to the without World Champion, he seems to want to make quiet moves that (hopefully) don't without put him at a further disadvantage.} 
48.f4 
{Capa continues to chip away at Black's mobility by controlling squares on without Black's half of the board. Now he can blockade the e-pawn with a Knight without outpost on e5.} 
Be8 
{Yates sees the coming (unpreventable) 49.Ne5, so he moves the Bishop back out without of harm's way.} 
49.Ne5 
{If Black had kept his Bishop on d7, the e5-Knight would now be attacking it.} 
Ra8 
{Yates keeps reshuffling his pieces. His plan now is to move the Bishop off of without the back rank so that the Rook can use the rank to quickly shift to the without Kingside.} 
50.Rc1 
{Capa's Rook takes over the open c-file. It now controls c6, making a future without Nc6 or Rc6 possible.} 
Bf7 
{Yates would like to get rid of White's powerful, centrally-posted Knights. He without offers his Bishop in exchange for one of them.} 
51.Rc6 
{Capa correctly sees that a central Knight is more of an advantage in this without position than a "bad" Bishop, so he declines the trade. He's more interested without in moves like 52.Nd6, driving the Bishop back to g8.} 
Bg8 
{The poor Bishop is driven back to g8. Black's mobility is approaching nil.} 
52.Nc5 
{The White Knight doubles up on the blockaded e-pawn.} 
Re8 
{The Rook defends the endangered pawn.} 
53.Ra6 
{Capa intends to next check the Black King with Ra7+.} 
Re7 
{The Black Rook advances to control a7 (taking it away from White) while still without defending the e-pawn.} 
54.Ka3 
{Capa starts thinking about advancing his passed pawn. The King covers b4 to without allow the pawn to move ahead.} 
Bf7 
{Yates doesn't have a whole lot of options here. He plays a "waiting move" without that doesn't damage his position.} 
55.b4 
{The White passed pawn continues its advance.} 
Nc7 
{Yates can't sit still forever. He begins an attempt to free his position, without starting with an attack on the White Rook.} 
56.Rc6 
{The Rook counters by striking back at the Knight.} 
Nb5+ 
{The Black Knight blockades the pawn and checks the King.} 
57.Kb2 
{57.Ka4 just leads to 57...Ra7+, so Capa backs up with the King.} 
Nd4 
{The Black Knight continues its tour, attacking the Rook again.} 
58.Ra6 
{The Rook withdraws to the open file.} 
Be8 
{The Black Bishop now covers b5, preventing the further advance of the b-pawn.} 
59.g4 
{The g-pawn advances to cut down the Knight's mobility. Now f5 is off-limits without to the Black Knight.} 
Kf6 
{Yates hopes to trick Capa into playing g5+, after which the Black Knight will without be able to occupy the hole on f5.} 
60.Ne4+ 
{Capablanca doesn't fall for it. He checks the King instead, driving it back.} 
Kg7 
{The Black King is forced to back off.} 
61.Nd6 
{A White Knight once again encroaches on Black's territory, this time without attacking the Black Bishop.} 
Bb5 
{Yates makes an evaluation of the position. He realizes that a without centrally-placed White Knight is more valuable than his own Bishop. He without offers the Bishop in exchange for White's e6-Knight.} 
62.Ra5 
{Capa chooses to decline the trade, and doubles up on the Bishop instead.} 
Bf1 
{Since White declined the trade, Yates finally gets some use out of his without Bishop. The Bishop is moving around behind the White pawns, to attack them without from the rear (and to control h3. Why? You'll see...).} 
63.Ra8 
{Capa makes another space-grabbing move. The Rook now controls Black's first without rank, limiting the mobility of the Black pieces.} 
g5 
{Yates will now stick White with doubled pawns. If White allows ...gxh4, the without Black h-pawn will be difficult to stop (Ra3 doesn't work, because the Black without Bishop controls h3).} 
64.fxg5 
{This is practically forced, for reasons we've already seen.} 
hxg5 
{Black keeps on trading pawns...} 
65.hxg5 
{...and White takes back. Capa has a two-pawn advantage, but it doesn't mean without much since these pawns are very weak (doubled AND isolated!).} 
Bg2 
{The White Rook is now forced to move, since the Bishop attacks it.} 
66.Re8 
{Capa offers a Rook exchange (66...Rxe8 67.Nxe8+).} 
Rc7 
{With no hope of getting his passed pawn going, Yates declines the trade. without He'll take his chances with the Rooks on the board.} 
67.Rd8 
{If Yates won't trade voluntarily, Capablanca will trick him into a trade! without Capa knows his opponent, and knows that he'll play 67...Nc6 to attack the without White Rook.} 
Nc6 
{Yates does the expected. He'd love nothing better tha for Capa to play without 68.Nxc6 so that he can reply ...Rxc6 and get one of the hated White Knights without off of the board.} 
68.Ne8+ 
{But Capa fools him! Now Black is forced to trade Rooks (Black can't save both without the Rook and Knight)! But first, Black must get his King out of check...} 
Kf8 
{...which he does.} 
69.Nxc7+ 
{Capa grabs the Black Rook, unveiling a discovered check against the Black without King.} 
Nxd8 
{Yates exercises the only reasonable option. Now White is sitting pretty, with without two Knights in Black territory (posted on dark squares, where the Black without Bishop can't touch them), and passed pawns on both sides of the board.} 
70.Kc3 
{The White King heads for the board's center (using the dark squares, of without course!).} 
Bb7 
{With two of his pieces (the pawn and Knight) "frozen", Yates must move either without the Bishop or King. The Bishop moves to the b-file to block the White b-pawn without from reaching the promotion square.} 
71.Kd4 
{The White King has made it ot the board's center. Now it can quickly move to without any spot on the board where it's needed.} 
Bc8 
{The Bishop backs up to c8 to overprotect the e-pawn. Now either the Bishop or without Knight will be free to act when needed (as long as one of them stays behind without to guard the pawn).} 
72.g6 
{With passed pawns on both sides of the board, Capa can create multiple without threats that are hard to meet.} 
Nb7 
{The Black Knight becomes active (while the Black Bishop guards the e-pawn). without From b7 the Knight prevents the White King from moving to c5 to support the without advance of the b-pawn.} 
73.Ne8 
{Surprise move! Capa tries to trap Yates! Do you see why the Black King can't without possibly capture the Knight?} 
Nd8 
{If Yates had fallen for the trap and captured the Knight, White would have without promoted the g6-pawn. The Knight comes back and resumes the overprotection without of the e-pawn. Yates must come up with another defensive plan.} 
( 72...Kxe8 
{Black can't capture on e8...} 
74.g7 
{...because the pawn will now promote! The Black King can't approach the pawn, without because White controls both f7 and f8. Black is powerless to prevent the without pawn from becoming a Queen next move.} 
) 
74.b5 
{Now the other passed pawn advances. Pawn advances on two sides of the board without in the endgame are often very difficult for the opponent to deal with.} 
Kg8 
{Yates blocks the f-pawn's promotion square. Notice that f6, f7, g6, and g7 without are all controlled by White's Knights and are therefore off-limits to without Black's King.} 
75.g5 
{Capablanca sees that Black is in "zugzwang" -- any move Black makes will without weaken his posistion. Capa plays a "waiting move" to pass the move back to without Black.} 
Kf8 
{Yates curses under his breath. He's in "zugzwang" and forced to move when he without doesn't want to (because all he has left are moves that weaken his game).} 
76.g7+ 
{The pawn advances under the protection of the e8-Knight. Black is running out without of time.} 
Kg8 
{Yates again blocks the pawn's promotion...} 
77.g6 
{...and Capa moves up the other pawn, trapping the King. Yates forsees the without inevitable White moves: Ke3 (to prevent ...e6-e5+), Ng4, and Nf6 mate. The without Englishman resigns.}

1.Nf3 
{Bogo develops his Kingside Knight toward the center, supporting the d2-d4 without push and denying the e5-square to Black. This move is non-committal: Black without doesn't know if White will set up a pawn center or try for control from the without flanks. } 
d5 
{Marshall (Black) tips his hand from the start, committing to controlling the without center by occupying it with his pawns. From now on, he'll try to keep at without least one pawn established in the center.} 
2.d4 
{Bogo reveals that he, too, plans on a policy of central control by without occupation. Now he may try to set up an e2-e4 pawn advance, or else try to without increase his control of e5 to be able to safely post a piece there.} 
e6 
{Marshall plays a questionable pawn push. Although he props up the d5-pawn without (which was not yet endangered) and releases his dark-squared Bishop, he's without penned in his light-squared Bishop. Maybe 2...Nf6 or 2...c5 were without better. } 
3.Bf4 
{Bogo develops another piece and increases his grip on e5. Perhaps he'll be without able to establish an outpost here later. Also, he can now release his other without Bishop by playing e2-e3 without blocking in his dark-square without Bishop. } 
Bd6 
{Marshall challenges the White control of the center with this move. He dares without White to trade off the Bishops: after 4.Bxd6 Qxd6 Black would actually have without a slight lead in development.} 
4.e3 
{Bogo declines the Bishop trade, preferring instead to prop up both the without d4-pawn and f4-Bishop, releasing his light-square Bishop as well.} 
Bxf4 
{Marshall makes another questionable move. He decides to trade his "good" without Bishop for White's "bad" Bishop -- usually a bad idea. In return, he'll without stick White with doubled f-pawns...} 
5.exf4 
{...which in this case isn't too bad! Now White has a firm grip on e5 and can without easily post his Knight there (although Black can still kick the Knight out without by playing ...f7-f6). } 
c5 
{Marshall again challenges White, threatening one of the guardians of e5. He's without hoping to trade off his flank pawn for White's only remaining center pawn.} 
6.dxc5 
{Bogo makes the trade, giving up his only center pawn. Now White has a pawn without superiority on each flank while Black enjoys a central majority. White without should attack on the flanks while Black should strike in the center.} 
Qa5+ 
{Marshall springs a double attack! He checks the White King and attacks the without c5-pawn at the same time! How should White respond? } 
7.c3 
{Bogo blocks the check. He could also have tried Nc3, but c2-c3 gives his without Queen open access to the Queenside and adds the c3-pawn's influence to d4, without helping to prevent the advance of Black's d-pawn.} 
Qxc5 
{Of course, Marshall brings his double attack to its logical conclusion by without capturing the c5-pawn.} 
8.Bd3 
{Bogo develops another Kingside piece. The Bishop is better placed here than without on e2, because it controls more space on two diagonals (b1-h7 and without a6-f1). } 
Nf6 
{Marshall centralizes his Knight and clears the deck for castling on the without Kingside.} 
9.O-O 
{Since there are no longer any White center pawns, the White King is finding without the center kind of drafty. Bogo gets his King to safety on the flank and without moves his Rook toward the two center files, where it will be better placed.} 
O-O 
{Marshall flanks his King as well. Now he'll need to consider developing his without Queenside pieces and bringing a Rook to c8 to command the open c-file.} 
10.Nbd2 
{Bogo develops his Queenside Knight to its logical square (better than Na3), without where it threatens to leap to b3 and chase away the Black Queen. The without drawback to this move is that it blocks the White Queen's defense of the without d3-Bishop. } 
Nc6 
{The development of Black's Queenside pieces begins. Marshall centralizes his without Knight, supporting a possible e6-e5 advance. The Knight also has chances of without relocating to the Kingside later (Nc6-e7-f5 or g6).} 
11.Ne5 
{Bogo's Knight jumps to the natural outpost on e5 (safe now because the Black without f6-Knight blocks f7-f6). Even if Black plays ...Nxe5, White's reply fxe5 without gives White a center pawn again.} 
Rd8 
{Marshall brings his Rook to d8 to help support the advance of his c8-Bishop. without He may also be contemplating a d5-d4 advance (remember, you usually want to without attack where you have a pawn majority).} 
12.Re1 
{Bogo's Rook grabs the half-open e-file, supporting his Knight. White has a without pawn disadvantage in the center but it's somewhat offset by the open d- and without e-files which can be dominated by his Queen and Rooks.} 
Bd7 
{Marshall proceeds with his planned Bishop advance. It would be to White's without disadvantage to trade his well-placed e5-Knight for Black's ineffective without Bishop.} 
13.Ndf3 
{Bogo threatens to play 14.Ng5 (doubling up on the f7-pawn, striking at the without base of the Black d5-f7 pawn chain). See how Bogo hangs on to the initiative without by making moves that force a response from Black. } 
h6 
{Marshall takes away any chance of White playing Ng5 by guarding that square without with a pawn. But now he's weakened his Kingside pawn structure slightly.} 
14.g4 
{WOW! Bogo fearlessly weakens his own Kingside pawn structure in order to without bring another unit up for the attack. He threatens 15.g5, followed by either without ...Nh7 16.gxh6 gxh6 or 15...hxg5 16.Nxg5, both of which are bad for Black.} 
Nxe5 
{Marshall has to defuse the White time bomb, so he decides to weaken the White without attack by exchanging pieces.} 
15.Nxe5 
{Obviously, Bogo must recapture or remain behind by a Knight. He maintains his without Knight outpost on e5.} 
Bc6 
{Now that there's no White Knight on f3, some of the sting is taken out of the without g4-g5 pawn push. This buys Marshall time to shift his Bishop out of his without d8-Rook's way.} 
16.Qe2 
{Sensing that Marshall is going to try to open up the center by pushing his without d-pawn, Bogo decides that it would be wise to get his Queen off of the same without file as the Black Rook (to cut down the chances of an unpleasant surprise!).} 
Ne4 
{Marshall establishes his own Knight outpost in White's territory. He also without puts pressure on the pinned (!) f2-pawn. } 
17.Rad1 
{Bogo brings his Rook over to d1 and takes control of the half-open d-file. without Notice how well-placed the White Queen and Rooks are, commanding the without half-open center files.} 
Rac8 
{If commanding a half-open file is good for White, it must be just as good for without Black. Marshall's Rook slides over to the half-open c-file.} 
18.Kg2 
{The King advances, stopping the pin on the f2-pawn. Now White could try without f2-f3, kicking the Black Knight off of its outpost, but that cuts off the without White e5-Knight's only retreat square after Black plays f7-f6!} 
Ba4 
{Marshall nudges the d1-Rook off of the half-open file.} 
19.Rc1 
{Bogo saves the Rook and threatens to push his c-pawn to c4. Would 19.b3 have without worked? See the variation.} 
( 19.b3 
{19.b3 would most certainly NOT have worked, and in this variation, we'll find without out why. White blocks the attack on his Rook by pushing the pawn and without attacking the Black Bishop. But the c3-pawn is hanging...} 
Nxc3 
{...so Black snags it and forks the White Queen and d1-Rook to boot. We could without end the variation here, but things get even worse for White so we'll without sadistically continue... } 
20.Qc2 
{White has to move his Queen, so he'll bting it to a square where it can without recapture the Knight after 20...Nxd1.} 
Nxd1 
{Black obviously makes the capture. Now he's a Rook and pawn ahead.} 
21.Bh7+ 
{White could either play Qxd1 immediately, or play the "spite check" here without (which isn't possible after Qxd1). He goes for the check.} 
Kf8 
{The King must move to stop the check. Rather than cornering the King, Black without moves it toward the center of the board.} 
22.Qxd1 
{Now White grabs the offending Knight.} 
Bc6 
{The Bishop (which has been in danger all this time!) pulls back to a safe without square.} 
23.Nxc6 
{White trades his Knight for the Bishop and threatens the d8-Rook. What's the without best way for Black to recapture?} 
Qxc6 
{Now Black is ahead by the exchange and a pawn. He also has a dangerous without supported passed d-pawn and, when the pawn advances, a discovered check on without the White King by the Queen! White says, "This stinks!"} 
) 
18...f6 
{Marshall continues to upset White's game by driving the e5-Knight off of its without outpost square. Now the e6-pawn is hanging. White has no immediate threats without against it, but it could become a weakness later.} 
20.Nf3 
{The Knight retreats to the only safe square.} 
Bc6 
{The Bishop comes back to c6, where it could check the White King later (after without a lot of wood gets out of the way, of course!).} 
21.Nd4 
{Bogo's Knight leaps forward and strikes at the weak e6-pawn, threatening a without fork of the Black Queen and d8-Rook. The square f3 is now clear for White to without push f2-f3 and drive out the Black Knight as well. } 
Qd6 
{Marshall withdraws his Queen to cover e6, preventing the White Knight from without capturing the pawn and setting up the vicious fork. He also provides a without retreat square for his Knight after White plays f2-f3.} 
22.f3 
{Bogo plays the anticipated move and drives the Black Knight from its outpost.} 
Nc5 
{The Black Knight retreats to the square prepared for it.} 
23.Bb1 
{Bogo likes the way his Bishop commands the b1-h7 diagonal and pressures the without Black Kingside. Not wanting to give up the Bishop to 23...Nxd3, he pulls it without back to a safe square.} 
Bd7 
{Marshall has no intention of trading his Bishop for a Knight either, so he without withdraws his Bishop to a safe square.} 
24.Qc2 
{Bogo threatens to invade the Black King's domain with 25.Qh7+. The Black King without couldn't recapture because the b1-Bishop would be protecting the White without Queen. } 
f5 
{Marshall advances his pawn and blocks the White Queen's path to h7. If you without look ahead, you'll see that Black can't possibly come out ahead in material without here. It's a planned pawn sacrifice to open up somes lines for Black.} 
25.gxf5 
{TRIPLED PAWNS!!! How often do you see that?! Of course, the pawns won't stay without tripled for long, as Black is about to recapture. } 
exf5 
{As anticipated, Black recaptures at f5. Now the Black Queen has easy access without to the Kingside, where it will help to blunt White's attack.} 
26.Nxf5 
{The Knight recaptures and threatens the Black Queen. If 26...Bxf5 27.Qxf5, without White's threat of Qh7+ stands, so how should Black reply here?} 
Qg6+ 
{Black saves his Queen, checks White, and piles up on the White f5-Knight.} 
27.Ng3 
{Bogo pulls back his Knight to block check and uncovers an attack on the Black without Queen from the White Queen.} 
Qxc2+ 
{Marshall has no choice but to trade Queens. Other moves lead Black down the without road to ruin. However, once the Queens come off the board, Black doesn't without stand too badly. The pawn sacrifice on move 24 worked!} 
28.Bxc2 
{Bogo completes the trade. Now White is a pawn ahead, but his attack has been without stopped. Bogo will have to come up with a new plan.} 
Ne6 
{Marshall shifts his Knight and threatens to capture the f4-pawn with without check. } 
29.Ne2 
{Bogo pulls back his Knight to defend the f4-pawn. The downside is that he without blocks the e1-Rook's control of the e-file. Maybe 29.Nh5, defending the pawn without and putting pressure on the Black Kingside would have been better.} 
Rf8 
{The Rook piles up on the poor f4-pawn. Marshall looks up from the board and without stares at Bogoljubow. The American is determined to win back his sacrificed without pawn!} 
30.f5 
{Bogo smiles and simply advances the pawn, which is protected by the without c2-Bishop. Now the Black Knight is under attack!} 
Nd8 
{The Knight is forced to retreat. Although moving to d8 breaks communication without between the Rooks, it's probably still better than ...Nc7. From d8 the without Knight can jump to a center-controlling post on c6.} 
31.Nd4 
{Bogo adds his Knight's support to the menaced pawn on f5.} 
Nc6 
{Uh-oh. Marshall seeks to undermine the f5-pawn by attacking one of its without defenders. This is a valuable tactic to learn -- you can frequently win a without pawn or piece by capturing or exchanging off one of its defenders.} 
32.Bb3 
{Rather than give up a pawn by exchanging Knights, Bogo springs a without counterthreat by attacking the Black d5-pawn. If Black now takes the without f5-pawn, White responds by capturing the d5-pawn...} 
Bxf5 
{...which is exactly what happens. Black knocks off the annoying pawn. Now his without Bishop and f8-Rook have open lines leading to the White Kingside.} 
33.Bxd5+ 
{Whiite picks off the d5-pawn and checks the Black King as well, picking up a without tempo (since Black must waste a move reacting to the check).} 
Kh8 
{The most intelligent move to get out of check. 33...Kh7 puts the King on without another light square, subject to future harassment by the White light-square without Bishop.} 
34.Bxc6 
{Why trade a Bishop for a Knight? Why not 34.Nd4xc6? See the variation. In without this position, Black must recapture on c6, and White still threatens Nxf5.} 
( 34.Nxc6 
{White could play Nxc6...} 
bxc6 
{...but after ...bxc6, the White Bishop is threatened and must retreat.} 
35.Bb3 
{After the forced retreat, it's now Black's move to do what he wants. White without has lost the initiative.} 
) 
33...bxc6 
{As stated before, Black must recapture. Now White still has the threat of without 35.Nxf5 Rxf5, getting the last two minor pieces off the board and leaving without Black down a pawn in a Rook-and-pawn endgame. } 
35.Re5 
{Bogo surprises everyone with this move. He hits the Bishop a second time, but without now the Bishop can escape. Better were either 35.Nxf5 or 35.Re7, attacking without the a7-pawn.} 
Bd7 
{Marshall retreats the Bishop to d7, the only safe square. On d7, it also without prevents the White e-Rook from menacing the a-pawn after 36.Re7 (i.e. 36.Re7 without Rcd8).} 
36.b4 
{Bogo, enjoying a 3-2 Queenside pawn advantage, begins the mobilization of his without pawn majority. Why the b-pawn? Generally speaking, mobilize your pawn without majority by advancing the unopposed pawn first.} 
Rf6 
{Marshall advances his Rook to a more flexible square. Now he can double his without Rooks (...Rcf8) or attack the White King (...Rg6+).} 
37.Rce1 
{Bogo doubles his Rooks and creates a battery on the e-file. Doubling your without Rooks means doubling their strength.} 
Kh7 
{Although two pieces (the c8-Rook and d7-Bishop) prevent White from playing without Re8+, Marshall doesn't want to tie the two pieces up. He gets his King off without of the back rank and into a cozy little pocket, sheltered by friendly pawns.} 
38.Ra5 
{Bogo undoubles his Rooks in order to lash out at the undefended a7-pawn.} 
Rc7 
{Marshall just advances his Rook to defend the threatened a-pawn.} 
39.Rc5 
{Why here? Because after 40.b5, Black can't capture the pawn by ...cxb5 without because of White's reply 41.Rxc7! The Black c-pawn is pinned!} 
a6 
{Of course, you always try to hit a pinned piece again and again until you without have enough force piled up on it to win it. Marshall knows this and prevents without White from hitting the c6-pawn again with the b-pawn. Now the b-pawn can't without advance.} 
40.a4 
{Bogo is relentless in his pursuit of the c6-pawn. He brings up the a4-pawn to without support the b4-pawn's advance. Now he threatens 41.b5 axb5 42.axb5, after without which the Black c6-pawn is history.} 
Rc8 
{Marshall defeats Bogo's plan by dropping the Rook back to a square where it's without defended by the d7-Bishop, releasing the pin on the c6-pawn. Check out the without variation to White's next move to see how this works.} 
41.h4 
{Since his attack on the c6-pawn has been foiled, Bogo has to come up with without another plan. He grabs space on the Kingside and restricts Black by without advancing his h-pawn. Now ...g5 is met by hxg5 hxg5, Rh1+.} 
( 41.b5 
{Here's how 40...Rc8 stymies White's plan to win a second pawn. In this without variation, White blindly forges ahead with his original plan and pushes the without b-pawn.} 
axb5 
{Black grabs the pawn, preventing White from winning the c-pawn after 42.bxc6.} 
42.axb5 
{White, thinking that the c6-pawn is still pinned, recaptures and piles up on without the c6-pawn at the same time.} 
cxb5 
{Black's c-pawn surprises White by grabbing his b-pawn.} 
43.Rxc8 
{White grabs the Rook...} 
Bxc8 
{...and the Bishop recaptures. The Black Rook dropped back to c8 earlier to without allow this very move.} 
44.Nxb5 
{The Knight snaps up the hanging pawn. True, Black is still behind by a pawn, without but if the Black Rook hadn't dropped back to c8, Black would have been TWO  without pawns down!} 
) 
40...Rg6+ 
{Marshall's Queenside is secure for the moment, so he shifts his attention to without the Kingside. He begins an attack by checking White's King.} 
42.Kh2 
{The White King retreats to a dark square, where it can't be molested by without Black's light-squared Bishop.} 
Rf8 
{Marshall brings his other Rook over to the Kingside. He threatens to play without ...Rf4,  which attacks the White h-pawn. } 
43.h5 
{Bogo advances the h-pawn, nullifying the threat of ...Rf4 and launching a without threat of his own -- the h-pawn attacks Black's g6-Rook. } 
Rd6 
{The Rook retreats to the only possible square (any other square loses without material for Black. Check it out and see!).} 
44.Re7 
{Bogo shoves his e-Rook into the midst of the Black position, where it sticks without like a bone in Marshall's throat. Now the g7-pawn is pinned. } 
Kg8 
{Marshall prepares to play Rf8-f7 in an attempt to get the e7-Rook out of his without hair, either by exchanging it off or forcing it to move.} 
45.Ra5 
{Bogo sidetracks Marshall by attacking the a6-pawn with his Rook. } 
Ra8 
{Marshall abandons his idea of a Rook trade and defends his menaced pawn without instead.} 
46.Re4 
{Bogo has reached an impasse here. There really aren't any moves to be made without that significantly improve his position, so he decides to drop back, waiting without to see what Marshall does.} 
Kf7 
{Marshall advances his King, denying White's Rook the use of e7 and without e8. } 
47.Re2 
{Bogo continues his policy of playing non-committal moves, awaiting further without developments by Black.} 
g6 
{Marshall plays aggressively. He advances his g-pawn in an attempt to get a without Kingside passed pawn.} 
48.hxg6+ 
{Bogo grabs the pawn. After Marshall recaptures with the King, BOTH players without will have a Kingside passed pawn: White on the f-file, Black on the h-file.} 
Rxg6 
{SURPRISE! Marshall recaptures with the Rook instead of the King! Now he'll without probably advance the h-pawn and put the g6-Rook behind it on h6 for support.} 
49.Rae5 
{Bogo doubles up his Rooks again on the e-file. Now, since the a6-Rook is no without longer endangered, Black's a8-Rook is freed up for duty elsewhere.} 
Rd8 
{The a-Rook shifts over to guard the Bishop, preventing White from winning it without by 50.Re7+ Kf8 51.Rxd7.} 
50.Re7+ 
{The White Rook piles in anyway and checks the Black King.} 
Kf8 
{The Black King retreats to the first rank, leaving the g6-Rook unattended.} 
51.R7e6 
{Bogo's Rook comes back and attacks the Black Rook on g6, hoping to provoke a without massive series of trades on e6 (see the variation to Black's next move).} 
Kf7 
{The Black King returns to f7 and defends the g6-Rook. Why didn't Black play without Bxe6? See the variation to find out why.} 
( 50...Bxe6 
{If Black plays ...Bxe6, White wins another pawn. Here's how...} 
52.Nxe6+ 
{The Knight dives in and snaps off the Bishop. Now the Knight has set up a without three-way fork of the Black King and both Rooks!} 
Rxe6 
{Black has no choice but to recapture. If he doesn't, White will win the without exchange by trading his Knight for one of Black's Rooks.} 
53.Rxe6 
{Now White recaptures and threatens two Black pawns. Black can only defend one without of them (probably the c-pawn). White will grab the other pawn and should win without easily with his two-pawn advantage. } 
) 
52.Nxc6 
{Black didn't play 51...Bxe6 because it would allow White to win a pawn. But without there's more than one way to skin a cat! Bogo finds another way to win a without pawn, starting by sacrificing his Knight!} 
Bxc6 
{The Bishop has to recapture, or else White will grab a Rook with 53.Nxd8.} 
53.Rxg6 
{Bogo continues his combination by making another forcing move, this time without capturing the g6-Rook.} 
Kxg6 
{Again, Black is forced to recapture or fall behind in material.} 
54.Re6+ 
{And now Bogo gets to the point: a double attack against the Black King and without Bishop! Bogo wins the Black Bishop (which gets back the equivalent of the without Knight he sacrificed) and he'll be two pawns ahead. } 
Kg5 
{Marshall gets the King out of check, moving to a square where it still without defends the h6-pawn.} 
55.Rxc6 
{Bogo grabs the Bishop and wins back his sacrificed material. Now White is up without by two pawns and should have no trouble winning this game.} 
a5 
{Marshall advances the threatened pawn. If White replies 56.bxa5, the White without pawn structure is wrecked: doubled a-pawns, and all four pawns would be without isolated. The four pawns would become targets for Black's Rook.} 
56.Kg3 
{Bogo doesn't intend to play 56.bxa5 and give Marshall a fighting chance. He without advances his King instead to protect his f-pawn and inhibit the advance of without the Black King and h-pawn. Marshall knows he's busted, so he resigns.}

1.d4 
{Capa opens with a center-controlling pawn push. Because the d-pawn is defended by the Queen, it's harder for Black to exchange it. The position is therefore liable to stay closed.} 
Nf6 
{Maroczy responds with a different kind of center-controlling move. The Knight controls e4 and d5. This move is less committal than 1...d5; Black can continue with ...g6 (in the hypermodern style) or the more traditional ...d5.} 
2.Nf3 
{The Kingside Knight springs forward and adds its influence over the center squares d4 and e5.} 
d5 
{Maroczy mirrors Capablanca's moves. But he can't do this forever. Sooner or later, he must vary his approach.} 
3.Bf4 
{Capa plans to advance the e=pawn to e3, but doesn't want to trap the Bishop behind the pawn. So he develops the Bishop first.} 
c5 
{Maroczy puts pressure on the White center. He wants to play ...cxd4 (after some further preparation), exchanging a flank pawn for a more valuable center pawn.} 
4.e3 
{As expected, Capa props up the d4-pawn by advancing the e-pawn one square.} 
Qb6 
{This is a pretty well-known ploy; now that White's dark-squared Bishop has moved, the b2-pawn is undefended. The Black Queen moves out and threatens the b2-pawn. } 
5.Qc1 
{The White Queen slides over and covers the b2-pawn. } 
Nc6 
{Maroczy continues his development, putting further pressure on the White center. The d4-pawn is attacked three times and only defended twice.} 
6.c3 
{The c-pawn covers the d-pawn, which is now sufficiently defended.} 
Bf5 
{The Bishop develops usefully, slicing across the central e4-square and attacking the b1-Knight.} 
7.dxc5 
{The fact that his most powerful piece, the Queen, is tied to the defense of a lowly pawn isn't lost on the World Champion. He decides to maneuver a Knight to b3 to block the Black Queen's threat to the b2-pawn. But to successfully post the Knight there, he must first eliminate the possibility of ...c4 (which would drive away the Knight). He removes the Black c-pawn from the board.} 
Qxc5 
{Of course, Maroczy must recapture or be behind in material.} 
8.Nbd2 
{The Knight is headed for b3, as we discussed.} 
Rc8 
{Rooks belong on open files. As there are no Black pawns on the c-file, it's a good spot for the Rook.} 
9.Nb3 
{And the Knight finally lands on b3, bringing with it a threat to the Black Queen.} 
Qb6 
{The Queen must retreat, giving White the initiative.} 
10.Qd2 
{Capa puts pressure on Maroczy's d-pawn, which is defended by the f6-Knight.} 
e6 
{Maroczy overprotects his d-pawn and clears a path for the development of his dark-squared Bishop.} 
11.Bd3 $15 
{An old chess maxim is "when you have a cramped position, free it by exchanging". Here Capa attemps to do just that, offering a trade of light-squared Bishops. Now all of his Kingside pieces are developed.} 
Be4 
{Maroczy's idea is to tempt White into playing Bxe4; after the reply ...Nxe4, the Black Knight will dominate White's position, as well as threaten the White Queen.} 
12.Qe2 
{There are several reasons for this move: the Queen protects both the Bishop and Knight (...Bxf3 followed by Qxf3 instead of gxf3, doubling the White pawns) and White now has the option of playing a future Bxe4 without worrying about a threat on his Queen after ...Nxe4.} 
Be7 
{Maroczy completes his Kingside development by moving his dark-squared Bishop to the only safe square.} 
13.O-O 
{Capa protects his King by castling away from the center...} 
O-O 
{...and Maroczy does the same.} 
14.Bg5 
{This is one reason why Black's move ...e7-e6 was a good idea. Had the e-pawn not been pushed, the d5-pawn's only defender (the f6-Knight) would be attacked by Capa's Bishop.} 
Bxd3 
{Maroczy decides to swap off his bad Bishop. He may also be thinking of moving his Knight to e4 (once he's resolved the question of how to defend his e7-Bishop).} 
15.Qxd3 
{Capa is forced to recapture or be behind materially.} 
Rfe8 
{Maroczy protects his e7-Bishop, making the move ...Ne4 a real possibility (cramping White's game in the process).} 
16.Bxf6 
{Capa doesn't want to see the Black Knight find a home at e4, so he removes it from the board...} 
Bxf6 
{...and Maroczy recaptures.} 
17.Rfd1 
{The Rook goes to the open file. However, there may be a deeper meaning. Capablanca is one of the world's foremost endgame players. He may be considering a massive exchange in the center (18.Nd4 Nxd4 19.Bxd4 Nxd4 20.Qxd4 Qxd4 21.Rxd4), bringing on an early endgame where his skill may provide him with an advantage.} 
Red8 
{Maroczy seems unsure about how to proceed. This seems to be a useful waiting move -- the Black Rook now stands on the same file as the White Queen.} 
18.Qe2 
{When your opponent moves a Rook to the same file your Queen stands on, it's generally a good idea to move your Queen away. There's no immediate threat in this position, but accidents do happen. Capa sees that Maroczy is considering opening the center and decides to get his Queen out of harm's way.} 
Ne5 
{Maroczy is interested in advancing his central pawn pair, but White has many pieces guarding the center. Maroczy deems this a good time to thin out White's ranks.} 
19.Nxe5 
{Capa accepts the offer of a Knight...} 
Bxe5 
{...and Maroczy again evens the material.} 
20.Rd2 
{Capablanca prepares to create a Rook battery, doubling them on the d-file.} 
Bf6 
{Maroczy pulls back the Bishop, enabling the e-pawn to advance when the time is right.} 
21.Rad1 
{As expected, Capa doubles the Rooks.} 
Rc4 
{The Black Rook moves to a square from which is can shoot to either side of the board at a moment's notice. By vacating c8, the Rook also makes way for its brother to move to that square, creating a battery on the c-file.} 
22.Nc1 
{Most players would have chosen 22.Nd4 without hesitation. But that move actually encourages Black to play ...e5. Capa instead eyes the possibility of playing Nd3, turning his position into a defensive fortress.} 
Rdc8 
{Black creates a battery on the c-file.} 
23.Nd3 
{And Capa's position is now like a stone castle. The b2-pawn is defended by both the Knight and d2-Rook (and indirectly by the Queen). Should Black strike at the a2-pawn, all White needs to do is advance it one square. There is no immediate danger on the Kingside, as all of Black's forces aim at the other side of the board. In short, White has no weaknesses, and Maroczy will be hard-pressed to find a way to make any progress.} 
a5 
{Maroczy's idea is to start a Queenside minority attack to break up the White pawns.} 
24.a3 
{But the plan is doomed to failure. The a3-pawn prevents the kamikaze Black pawn from advancing close enough to do any harm.} 
Qc7 
{Maroczy's new idea is to shift the action over to the Kingside. The Queen takes aim down the diagonal, eyeing up the h2-pawn. The plan is to play ...Rh4.} 
25.g3 
{Capa scotches another of Maroczy's plans. The Queen "bites on granite" and h4 is now off-limits to the Black Rook.} 
b5 
{Maroczy still has thoughts of prying open the Queenside.} 
26.Kg2 
{The White King steps up into the pocket. It's relatively safe here, as Black lacks a light-squared Bishop.} 
Be7 
{In this position, it's harder for Black to blunder than it is for White (a false move by White could destroy his fortress from within). so Maroczy is content to make waiting moves. A possibility here was 26...Qb7, setting up a discovered check after ...d4.} 
27.Kg1 
{The inactivity on the Kingside gives Capa the freedom to make waiting moves of his own. The two masters could call it a draw here and no one would think the less of them for it. There's really no way for either side to make progress without a gross blunder being committed first.} 
Bd6 
{Maroczy plays another quiet move, avoiding the fireworks that would result after 27...b4.} 
( 26...b4 
{Prying open the Queenside.} 
28.cxb4 
{White could also take with the a-pawn.} 
axb4 
{Forced, to keep the material balance even.} 
29.axb4 
{Otherwise 29...bxa3 30.bxa3 Bxa3 loses a pawn.} 
Bxb4 
{Again evening the material.} 
30.Nxb4 
{Removing the d2-Rook's attacker.} 
Rxb4 
{Balancing the material once again.} 
31.Rd4 
{Now the Black Rook must run. White has a passed pawn, but nothing really will come of it. The position is still even. All those firewoks, and essentially nothing came of it. (Variation by Alekhine)} 
) 
28.Ra1 
{Discouraging ...b4, because of 28...b4 29.axb4 axb4 and the a1-Rook sits on a nice open file.} 
Qc6 
{Maroczy continues to probe, but the game is essentially dead.} 
29.R2d1 
{Each player is now just waiting to see if his opponent will err.} 
h6 
{Another essentailly pointless move. Maroczy may be thinking of advancing his Kingside pawns.} 
30.Qh5 
{The idea is to play Ne5, attacking the Black Queen with a double attack (Knight and Queen) on f7. But the obvious reply is ...Qe8, holding everything together nicely. Capa proposes a draw and Maroczy accepts. The players split the point.}

1.d4 
{It's a well-known fact that Maroczy hates to see 1.d4 when he has the Black without pieces. It's only logical that when he has White he plays the same move that without makes him the most uncomfortable as Black.} 
Nf6 
{Bogo doesn't commit himself to occupying the center with pawns by playing without 1...d5. He stays flexible by developing his Knight first, waiting to see how without White will respond.} 
2.Nf3 
{Maroczy doesn't want to go into the positions arising from 2.c4 for some without reason, so he plays a less-conventional developing move.} 
e6 
{Bogo supports his d-pawn's advance to d5 and telegraphs his intentions about without the f8-Bishop: it won't be fianchettoed but will be developed through the without center.} 
3.e3 
{Maroczy braces his d-pawn and allows for the development of his f1-Bishop. without The drawback: he's blocked in his c1-Bishop.} 
c5 
{Bogo challenges the White center. If White plays 4.dxc5, then 4...Bxc5 will without give Black the lead in development.} 
4.Bd3 
{Maroczy clears the deck for castling, moving the Bishop to a spot where it without covers e4, making that square unattractive to Black's f6-Knight. } 
d5 
{Bogo carves out a healthy slice of the center for himself by advancing his without d-pawn. Developing the c8-Bishop is still a problem, but at least it can without move to d7 now.} 
5.b3 
{This prevents the advance of the Black c-pawn (otherwise Black gets to play without 5...c4 6.Be2 Ne4, making White very sad). Maroczy is also able to play Bb1, without solving the problem of that Bishop's development.} 
Nc6 
{Bogo continues his development. ...Nb4 may be possible at a later opportune without moment.} 
6.O-O 
{Maroczy castles, completing his Kingside development.} 
Bd6 
{Bogo need to get the Bishop off of his first rank to be able to castle. It's without better to develop the Bishop to d6 rather than e7 because on d6 the Bishop without controls the b8-h2 diagonal. } 
7.Bb2 
{Maroczy fianchettoes his Bishop. He may decide to get his d-pawn out of the without way with dxc5, after which the Bishop will have control of the long a1-h8 without diagonal.} 
O-O 
{Bogo tucks the King away toward the corner and brings his Rook over toward without the center.} 
8.Ne5 
{Maroczy gambles that Bogo will be unwilling to trade a Bishop for a Knight at without this early stage of the game, and establishes a Knight outpost on e5.} 
Ne7 
{Bogo doesn't like the look of the e5-Knight and both Bishops bearing down on without his Kingside. He shifts the Knight toward that side of the board to help without defend against any possible attacks there.} 
9.Nd2 
{The Knight has limited potential for active play on the Queenside, so Maroczy without begins to shift it toward the Kingside.} 
b6 
{By advancing the pawn, Bogo creates a good developing square for his Bishop. without On b7, the Bishop will control the long a8-h1 diagonal and take aim at without White's Kingside.} 
10.f4 
{The pawn advances so that it won't be blocked in by a White piece posted on without f3. Maroczy might later bring his Rook into the game by way of Rf1-f3-h3 to without help in a Kingside attack. } 
Bb7 
{Bogo does the expected and fianchettos his Bishop. In tight, closed games without like this, the players are forced into a battle of maneuver. Their pieces without have to shift and squirm to find the absolute best squares to be posted on.} 
11.Qf3 
{Maroczy sees that ...Ne4 is now possible (11...Ne4 12.Nxe4 dxe4 13.Bxe4 without Bxe4), so he places the Queen on f3 to help keep the Black Knight off of e4.}

d5

3.c4

4.e3 
{And this is why. By advancing the e-pawn, White unleashes an attack on the without c4-pawn (from his light-squared Bishop). If Black tries to defend it with without ...b5, White just plays a2-a4 and attacks the defending pawn.} 
e6 
{Janowski advances his e-pawn and releases his dark-squared Bishop from its without back-rank prison.} 
5.Bxc4 
{Bogo snags the pawn, and the material is even again. But development is without uneven; White has developed two pieces and two pawns, while Black has just a without single piece and pawn off of their starting squares.} 
c5 
{Janowski challenges the White center, offering to swap a flank pawn for a without more valuable center one. He can also now play ...Nc6 without trapping the without c-pawn behind the Knight.} 
6.Nc3 
{Bogo is unconcerned. If ...cxd4, then Nxc4 and White's developmental lead without increases to three pieces and a pawn versus a piece and a pawn for Black.} 
Nc6 
{Janowski develops another piece and piles up on the d-pawn, attacking it for without a third time. But White has it covered three times, so there's no danger without yet.} 
7.O-O 
{It's usually a good idea to get your King out of the center as soon as without possible.} 
Be7 
{Janowski thinks that early castling is a fine idea, so he moves his Bishop without out and clears the way for Kingside castling.} 
8.Qe2 
{Bogo (after some quick calculation) sees that he has time to shift his Queen without and bring his Rook to d1 before Black starts swapping on d4 (8...cxd4 9.Rd1 without and the Black d-pawn is pinned to the Black Queen!).} 
O-O 
{Janowski realizes the futility of starting an exchange on d4, so he insures without his King's safety instead.}

Rac8 
{Janowski sets up a c-file battery, but that's really not his intention here. without He wants to guard c7 to prevent White's Rook from using it as a penetration without square (after the other pieces leave the file, of course).} 
15.Bd3 
{Bogo starts clearing the file to give his Rook more space.} 
Rfd8 
{"Rooks belong on open files". Now both players have their Rooks established without on the two open files. Since the Kings are trapped behind pawn walls, a without single misstep from either player could spell a quick mate!}

Nxe4 
{Allowing 17.Nxf6 Bxf6 18.Bxf6 gxf6 would blow open a hole in the Black King's without fortress, so Janowski finds it preferrable to exchange Knights.}

{The Knight blocks the file. Now there is a possibility of another exchange of without Knights.} 
Qb6

28.Qf3 
{The White Queen resumes its post on the long a8-h1 diagonal.}

30.Rb1 
{Bogo has three choices: 1) 30.Rxc4 Rxc4 and Black controls the c-file; 2) without 30.Bb2 and though the Bishop guards c1, the Bishop itself is undefended; 3) without abandon the file. He opts for 3.}

{...driving it from its post...} 
Bc2 
{...which leaves c2 undefended and able to be occupied by the Black Bishop.} 
32.Rbc1 
{Bogo's Rook can now reoccupy c1 because the Black Bishop shields c1 from the without Black Rooks and the White Knight helps guard c1 (which is why the Knight without retreated to e2 instead of attacking the Black Queen from f5).}

Re4

Qd5 
{The wily Frenchman sets a trap. Next is 38...Rxe3. If 39.Qxe3 then 39...Qxg2 without is mate! But if White just moves the Queen away, Black has won a pawn!} 
38.Bxe5

1.d4 
{Chess openings revolve around the struggle to occupy, control, or influence without the center. Alekhine (White) occupies d4 with a pawn. The pawn controls c5 without and e5, the Queen controls d2 and d3, and the c1-Bishop controls without d2-h6. } 
d5 
{Lasker (Black) controls his own piece of the center. The Black pawn on d5 without stops any further advance of White's d-pawn into Black without territory. } 
2.c4 
{Alekhine advances the c-pawn in an effort to goad Black into trading a vital without center pawn (his d-pawn) for a less-valuable White flank pawn (the c-pawn).} 
e6 
{Lasker knows that White's ultimate goal here is to play e2-e4 and gain a without central pawn duo on d4 and e4. After e7-e6, he insures that he'll still have without a pawn on d5 (to prevent e2-e4) even after pawns are swapped on d5 (cxd5, without exd5).} 
3.Nf3 
{The White Kingside Knight develops to a useful square where it keeps an eye without on the White d-pawn or can possibly leap to an outpost square on e5 later.} 
Nf6 
{Lasker has much the same idea with his Knight move. He overprotects the pawn without on d5, eyes a possible outpost on e4, starts clearing the deck for Kingside without castling, and seeks to prevent the White pawn push e2-e4.} 
4.Nc3 
{Alekhine develops another minor piece, strikes out at the d5-pawn again, and without adds the influence of another piece to e4, trying to support the planned without e2-e4 pawn advance. } 
Nbd7 
{Lasker develops his other Knight. He protects the f6-Knight and supports his without own possible pawn advance from e6 to e5 (at an opportune without moment). } 
5.cxd5 
{Alekhine decides that the time is right to trade a flank pawn for a more without valuable center pawn.} 
exd5 
{Lasker recaptures. Would 5...Nxd5 have worked? See the variation.} 
( 4...Nxd5 
{Here we'll see that capturing with the Knight would actually HELP White's without game...} 
6.e4 
{Rather than 6.Nxd5, White plays 6.e4 (which is really what he's wanted all without along). Now the Black Knight is forced to move.} 
Nxc3 
{Capturing White's Knight is Black's best bet here. 6...Nf6 only prompts White without to play 7.e5 and kick the Knight again.} 
7.bxc3 
{Now White has the d4-e4 pawn center he's dreamed of, open diagonals for the without development of his Bishops, and a half-open b-file for his a-Rook. No wonder without Black didn't play this variation in the actual game!} 
) 
6.Bf4 
{Alekhine develops another minor piece. He's looking at the possibility of without posting a piece at e5. The usual move here is Bg5, pinning the Black without f6-Knight to the Queen.} 
c6 
{Lasker allows his Queen access to the Queenside via the a5-d8 diagonal, and without keep White from launching a double attack against his c7-pawn after without 7.Nb5. } 
7.e3 
{Alekhine props up his Bishop, and at the same time gives his Kingside Bishop without a route to get off the first rank (via the a6-f1 diagonal). Notice that he without moved his dark-square Bishop first, so that it wouldn't get trapped behind without the pawn. } 
Nh5 
{Lasker launches a sortie against the well-placed f4-Bishop. Notice that the without Bishop can't move to escape capture; it's attacked no matter where it moves. without The Bishop is Black's if he wants it.} 
8.Bd3 
{Rather than waste time on fruitless moves of the f4-Bishop, Alekhine without continues his development by moving his last Kingside minor piece. Now the without way is clear for castling Kingside.} 
Nxf4 
{Lasker trades his Knight for White's bad Bishop.} 
9.exf4 
{Alekhine recaptures. Black has won White's bad Bishop and saddled him with without doubled f-pawns, but it took him three Knight moves to do it. Black has without fallen way behind in development.} 
Bd6 
{In an effort to make up some of his lost time, Lasker develops a piece and without simultaneously threatens the White f4-pawn. In your own games, develop with without a threat whenever possible. } 
10.g3 
{Alekhine shores up his endangered f4-pawn. But now the light squares on his without Kingside are incredibly weak. This is especially true of f3 and h3, as no without White pawns can ever guard those squares again. } 
O-O 
{Lasker continues his development by castling. Now his King is safe behind a without protective wall of pawns, and his Kingside Rook is a move away from taking without over the open e-file.} 
11.O-O 
{Neither the Kingside nor Queenside pawn structures look particularly safe for without a castled King, but White has to get the King out of the center before Black without plays 11...Re8+. Alekhine bites the bullet and castles Kingside.} 
Re8 
{The old chess adage bears repeating: Rooks belong on open files! Lasker knows without this, and siezes the open e-file. Now he's only one move behind in without development but getting his c8-Bishop out is going to be a problem. } 
12.Qc2 
{Alekhine grabs the opportunity to develop his Queen with a threat. He's without threatening to win a pawn with Bxh7 (Black couldn't recapture with his King without because the Bishop is protected by the Queen). } 
Nf8 
{Rather than create a weakness in his Kingside pawn structure with g7-g6 without (which would weaken f6 and h6), Lasker repositions his Knight in order to without guard the h7-pawn. This also solves the problem of how to get his c8-Bishop without out. } 
13.Nd1 
{Alekhine begins to reposition his Knight (since it's not doing much on c3). without He's heading for e3 obviously, where the Knight will have a little more without play. } 
f6 
{Lasker prevents White from establishing a Knight outpost on either e5 or g5. without He's trying to grab space and restrict White to his own half of the without board. } 
14.Ne3 
{Alekhine's Knight jumps again, closing off part of the e-file to Black's Rook without on e8. But this move has another purpose. He's trying to control without f5... } 
Be6 
{Lasker finally gets his Bishop off of the first rank. He doesn't attack the without Kingside by moving the Bishop to g4 or h3, because White has too many without options there for an immediate attack to work. The Bishop is held in reserve without instead.} 
15.Nh4 
{Alekhine prepares a Kingside attack. Now he has complete control of f5, and without will probably post a Knight here. A White Knight on f5 will attack the Black without d6-Bishop. White hopes to trade a Knight for one of Black's two Bishops.} 
Bc7 
{Lasker stops White's threat before it even gets started by moving the target without of the attack. But there's an ulterior motive to this move: Black will try without to play Bc7-b6 and attack White's isolated d-pawn. } 
16.b4 
{Alekhine launches a "minority attack". The b-pawn is a "kamikaze" that will without try to sacrifice itself in order to create weaknesses on Black's Queenside. without Watch and see...} 
Bb6 
{Lasker can't do much yet about the kamikaze pawn, so he sticks with his plan without to attack the isolated d-pawn. He follows a good principle: don't switch without plans in the middle of an operation without an important reason. } 
17.Nf3 
{Alekhine withdraws the Knight to protect the menaced d-pawn. Why didn't he without just play Qc3? Because it conflicts with his plan to advance the kamikaze without pawn. You'll see...} 
Bf7 
{Lasker starts to maneuver his Bishop to h5, where it will attack the hanging without Knight at f3. The two Bishops are acting like a pair of scissors, striking without at the center from two directions at once. } 
18.b5 
{The kamikaze pawn advances again. Now White threatens to win a pawn with without 19.bxc6 bxc6 20.Qxc6. But as soon as he moves the pawn, Alekhine grimaces! without Too late, he spotted a better move! See the variation.} 
( 18.Bf5 
{In this variation (by Alekhine himself, with additions by Tartakower), we see without the alternate move that Alekhine spotted too late. This Bishop move takes without the sting out of Black's threatened ...Bf7-h5.} 
Bh5 
{Black carries out his threat.} 
19.Bg4 
{White interposes the Bishop (protected by the e3-Knight).} 
Rxe3 
{Black might try to knock out the defending Knight (in a tactic known as without "removing the guard")...} 
20.Bxh5 
{...but White could just nail the hanging Black Bishop. Now Black has lost the without advantage of the Bishop pair. True, the Black Rook on e3 is an annoyance, without but White should be able to hold the position and get an even game.} 
) 
17...Bh5 
{Lasker proceeds to threaten the f3-Knight with his Bishop.} 
19.g4 
{Alekhine defends it by interposing the g-pawn, which also counterattacks the without Bishop. But the White Kingside looks sick, with a hanging f-pawn and holes without for Black to invade later. } 
Bf7 
{Discretion is the better part of valour. The Bishop retreats, having no without intention of sacrificing itself for a lowly pawn.} 
20.bxc6 
{Alekhine proceeds with his plan to win a pawn on the Queenside. The kamikaze without grabs the Black c-pawn.} 
Rc8 
{AH-HA! Lasker temporarily sacrifices the pawn, but ONLY temporarily, as the without White c6-pawn is pinned to the White Queen! The White pawn can't take the without Black b7-pawn, because of Black's reply ...Rxc2! } 
21.Qb2 
{Alekhine curses under his breath. He has no choice but to get his Queen out without of the line of fire, moving it to a square where it still defends the without isolated d4-pawn.} 
bxc6 
{Lasker gets his pawn back with ease. While it's true that the c-file is without closed to his Rook, the b-file is wide open should he choose to shift the without Rook to b8. He can also now hit the d4-pawn again with c6-c5 if he wants to without try that.} 
22.f5 
{Alekhine strengthens his sickly f-pawn by advancing it. He also takes e6 away without from the Black Knight, preventing it from invading White's Kingside via e6 without and f4. } 
Qd6 
{Lasker advances his Queen to a new post, from which it prepares to invade the without White position by moving to f4. At f4 it will attack both the White without f3-Knight and g4-pawn. } 
23.Ng2 
{Alekhine drops the Knight back to defend f4, keeping the Black Queen from without occupying it.} 
Bc7 
{Lasker sees that the dark-square Bishop's options are limited on b6, so he without pulls it back to c7 where it forms a battery in conjunction with the Black without Queen. The b-file is now open, ready for a Black Rook to occupy b8.} 
24.Rfe1 
{Alekhine sees that his position is inferior to Black's. He seeks to trade off without Rooks on the e-file, clearing off a possible future attacker and simplifying without the game.} 
h5 
{Lasker attempts to wreck the White Kingside even further. If 25.gxh5, then without ...Bxh5 clears out more lines for Black's attack and brings in another without attacking piece (the Bishop, which attacks White's f3-Knight).} 
25.h3 
{Alekhine bails frantically to keep the ship from going under. The pawn on h3 without allows White to answer ...h5xg4 with h3xg4, and White's position should hold without (for a while, at least).} 
Nh7 
{Lasker sets up a future Knight jump to g5, where it would attack both the without White f3-Knight and h3-pawn. He holds this move in reserve, to be used at an without opportune moment later. } 
26.Rxe8+ 
{Alekhine decides to simplify the game, trading off a pair of Rooks.} 
Rxe8 
{Lasker kills the checking Rook and maintains control of the e-file. Notice without that the e8-Rook can still slide over to b8 later to harass the White Queen.} 
27.Re1 
{I'm sure you remember this principle from earlier games: if you're under without attack, blunt your opponent's assault by exchanging pieces. Here Alekhine without seeks to do just that by swapping off the remaining Rooks.} 
Rb8 
{But Lasker will have none of that! Instead, the Rook slips away to b8 where without it attacks the White Queen. } 
28.Qc1 
{Of course, the Queen must retreat, so it goes to c1 where it can control the without open c1-h6 diagonal leading to the heart of Black's Kingside. Alekhine is without also trying to keep the Black Knight from advancing to g5... } 
Ng5 
{...but the Knight leaps forward anyway! The Black Knight now attacks the without White Knight which is left hanging on f3.} 
29.Ne5 
{Rather than trade Knights on g5 (see the variation), Alekhine finds another without ingenious way to make the trade...} 
( 29.Nxg5 
{Let's look at what would have happened if White had decided to trade on g5... without (Variation by Alekhine).} 
Qh2+ 
{Now that the White Knight no longer guards h2, it's safe for the Black Queen without to begin an invasion of White's Kingside.} 
30.Kf1 
{The only way to escape check (since Kxh2 is impossible; the c7-Bishop guards without the Queen).} 
fxg5 
{Black evens up the material by capturing the Knight. What will White do next?} 
31.Ne3 
{White has to move the Knight, otherwise Black will capture it with the Queen: without 31...Qh1+ 32.Ke2 Qxg2. Even so, Black will now go up by a pawn...} 
Qxh3+ 
{Black grabs the pawn with check.} 
32.Ke2 
{The only move that makes sense is to retreat the King.} 
hxg4 
{Black wins a second pawn. The White Kingside is a shambles. The White King without has been driven to the center of the board, where it will be hounded and without harassed by Black's pieces. No wonder Alekhine didn't trade Knights on g5!} 
) 
28...fxe5 
{Lasker finds his pawn to be overworked: it can't defend the g5-Knight and without take the White e5-Knight at the same time. Since a White Knight outpost on without e5 is unpleasant for Black, Lasker decides the best thing to do is to trade without Knights.} 
30.Qxg5 
{The White Queen crashes in and grabs the Black Knight. Now the Black e5-pawn without cuts its own pieces off from the White Kingside. The pawn has to move. Will without it capture its White counterpart on d4?} 
e4 
{NO! It advances, attacking the d3-Bishop. White is also in danger of losing without his Knight after 31...Qh2+ 32.Kf1 Qh1+ 33.Ke2 Qxg2. Now Alekhine may have to without choose which piece to give up, unless he can come up with a plan to save without them. } 
31.f6 
{Alekhine takes advantage of the pin on the g7-pawn to attack it and threaten without mate with 32.Qxg7#. How will Lasker respond? He could dissipate his attack without by swapping Queens: 31...Qxf6 32.Qxf6 gxf6. Or he could try something without else...} 
g6 
{Lasker salvages his attack by just advancing the pawn. Now he still threatens without both of White's minor pieces.}

{White wins back a pawn and checks the Black King (but it's not mate now, without because the King has moved).} 
Ke8 
{The King retreats to the only possible square.} 
37.Kc2 
{The White King comes to the c-file to prevent the Black Rook from invading on without the other flank. But the White position is a mess, with pawns hanging all without over the place. It's only a matter of time before Black comes crashing in without again.}

hxg4

33.Be2 
{Alekhine extricates his Bishop from danger and attacks the Black pawn on without g4. } 
gxh3 
{Lasker swipes another pawn and attacks the Knight on g2. Notice how the White without pawn structure is fragmented while Black has a strong pawn chain from c6 to without e4. }

{Taking advantage of the pin on the g6-pawn, Alekhine prepares to break without through on Black's Kingside.} 
Rb2 
{Lasker invades on the other wing, threatening the g2-Knight and the without a2-pawn. } 
35.Nh4 
{Alekhine piles up on the pinned g6-pawn, hitting it a third time with the without Knight.} 
Qxf4

{Since the central pawn position is fully developed, Capa knows that his pawns without will be operating mainly on the dark squares. This makes the dark-square without Bishop the "bad Bishop" (see Glossary), so Capa decides to swap it off.} 
Nxf6 
{Lasker recaptures with the Knight instead of the g7-pawn. Capturing with the without pawn would severely weaken the Black Kingside pawns and make castling on without that side a very bad idea.} 
8.Bd3 
{Capa clears the way for castling Kingside and brings his Bishop to a square without where it operates on two good diagonals (a6-f1 and b1-h7). The Bishop is without more actively placed here than it would be on e2.} 
Bb4 
{Lasker turns up the heat on the White c3-Knight, threatening to win a pawn by without 9...Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 Qxc3+. He's also cleared the way for his King to castle on without the Kingside. } 
9.Qb3 
{Rather than sliding his Queen laterally to c1 to guard the threatened Knight, without Capa develops it off of the back rank to b3 where it guards the Knight and without gets into the thick of the action.} 
dxc4 
{Lasker makes Capa "waste a tempo". Capa is now forced to capture the c4-pawn without with one of the threatened pieces. Both of these pieces have already moved  without once in the opening; having to move one again "burns up" a move for White.} 
10.Bxc4 
{By capturing with the Bishop, Capa sets up a battery on the a2-g8 diagonal. without But the battery "bites on granite", running smack into a protected pawn on without e6. } 
O-O 
{Lasker decides to castle, shuttling his King to safety and developing a Rook without at the same time.} 
11.O-O 
{Capa follows suit. Now the pressure on his c3-Knight is relieved, as the without Knight is no longer pinned.} 
Bxc3 
{Lasker trades a Bishop for the White Knight which defends d5. Now, if he can without find a way to break up the White Queen & Rook battery, he may be able to without post a piece on d5.} 
12.bxc3 
{Capa recaptures with the pawn, deciding that it's best to hang onto his Queen without for now (12.Qxc3 Qxc3 13.bxc3). The White Queenside is much stronger with without the Queen on the board.} 
b6 
{Lasker prepares to fianchetto his Bishop by advancing his b-pawn. Why not without play 12...b5? See the variation.} 
( 11...b5 
{Why not 12...b5? The idea of fianchettoing a Bishop is to control the long without diagonal (in this case a8-h1). That means that the c6-pawn must advance and without clear the diagonal for the Bishop.} 
13.Bd3 
{The threatened Bishop must retreat.} 
Bb7 
{Now Black fianchettos the Bishop, but the c6-pawn can't safely advance due to without White's reply dxc5. Had Black played b7-b6 instead, the b6-pawn's defense of without c5 would make the advance c6-c5 possible.} 
) 
13.Ne5 
{Capa attacks the weak c6-pawn. "But this doesn't accomplish much," Lasker without thinks, "since I intend to fianchetto the Bishop to b7 anyway." Could Capa without have a hidden motive?} 
Bb7 
{Lasker is forced to make the move he wanted to make anyway!} 
14.Be2 
{Capa voluntarily breaks up his battery! But wait a minute...if the e5-Knight without jumps to c4, then it attacks the Black Queen...} 
c5 
{Lasker advances the c-pawn and clears the long diagonal for his Bishop. The without Bishop is now lord and master of the a8-h1 diagonal.} 
15.Nc4 
{As expected, the Knight jumps to c4 to menace the Black Queen. Now Lasker without sees the purpose of 13.Ne5.} 
Qa6 
{The Black Queen retreats to the only safe square. Now, if the White Knight without moves, it uncovers an attack on the Queen from the e2-Bishop. But that without attack wouldn't work, because the Bishop is undefended (the Queen could take without it)...} 
16.Qb2 
{So Capa's Queen drops back and defends the Bishop! Now Lasker is just one without move away from disaster!} 
Bd5 
{This Bishop move serves a dual purpose: it attacks the c4-Knight (which is without now attacked twice and defended just once) and gives the Black Queen an without escape route via the a6-c8 diagonal.} 
17.Ne5 
{Capa moves the threatened Knight back to its outpost on e5 and uncorks the without discovered attack on the Black Queen.} 
Qc8 
{Obviously, Lasker retreats his Queen. Maybe 17...Qb7, setting up a battery on without the long diagonal and menacing the g2-pawn, would have been better. In any without case, White's combination has relieved the pressure on his Queenside.} 
18.a4 
{Capa advances his a-pawn with a couple of ideas in mind: the a1-Rook is no without longer tied to the pawn's defense, and there is now the possibility of a without White Queenside minority attack.} 
Nd7 
{Lasker pulls back his Knight to threaten the White e5-Knight. Lasker hopes to without provoke Capa into giving up his centrally-posted Knight by playing 19.Nxd7 without Qxd7.} 
19.c4 
{Rather than play the anticipated Knight trade, Capa looks ahead and sees a without way to unbalance the game and retain the initiative. He begins by grabbing without some Queenside space and attacking the Black Bishop.} 
Be4 
{Lasker saves his Bishop by bringing it to the strong central square e4. From without here it commands two diagonals (b1-h7 and a8-h1) and can retreat to either without the Kingside or Queenside if it's threatened without again. } 
20.Nxd7 
{Capa continues by grabbing the Knight and menacing the f8-Rook.} 
Qxd7 
{Lasker recaptures to keep the material even.} 
21.dxc5 
{Capablanca hangs on to the initiative by grabbing another pawn, forcing without Black's response.} 
bxc5 
{Lasker again has to recapture to keep the material balance even. Capa is without controlling the initiative by forcing these recaptures.} 
22.Qe5 
{Capa gets to the point of what he started on move 19. The Queen gets to the without center of the board (a GREAT post for the Queen in the late middlegame and without the endgame) and attacks the Black Bishop.} 
Qc6 
{Lasker answers a threat with a threat: he threatens to save his Bishop, grab without a pawn, and attack a White Rook by playing ...Bxg2.} 
23.f3 
{Capa nonchalantly plays 23.f3, stopping Black's threat cold and attacking the without Black Bishop a second time.} 
Bg6 
{Lasker pulls back the Bishop where it's guarded by two pawns and still without controls the b1-h7 diagonal.} 
24.Rfd1 
{Capablanca continues to build up his position. Now his Rook commands the open without d-file. } 
Rfd8 
{Lasker disputes Capa's ownership of the d-file.} 
25.Rxd8+ 
{Capa decides to trade off a pair of Rooks, checking the Black King in the without process.} 
Rxd8 
{Lasker has no choice but to capture the checking Rook. The position becomes without simpler as pieces leave the board.} 
26.Rd1 
{Capa, who rarely likes to take chances, continues to simplify the position, without offering another Rook trade. The chances of your opponent being able to without spring a surprise move on you decrease as more pieces come off the board.} 
Rxd1+ 
{Lasker has only two choices: trade off the Rooks or give up control of the without d-file.} 
27.Bxd1 
{Capa grabs the Black Rook and then offers Lasker a draw. Lasker thinks for a without few moments and accepts the offer. The game is drawn.}

1.d4

d5 
{Capablanca (Black) follows suit. He now controls c4 and e4. His light-square without Bishop is now free to develop. Also, the d5-pawn prevents White's d-pawn without from advancing into Black's territory. } 
2.Nf3 
{A good developing move. The Knight moves toward the center, protects the d4- without pawn, and strengthens White's hold on e5 (a square the Knight may want to without move to at an opportune time later on). } 
Nf6 
{Capablanca plays a "mirror-image" of Janowski's last move, with the same without ideas in mind (center control and possible later advancement to without e4). } 
3.c4 
{Janowski offers to gambit a pawn. He hopes to make Capa waste a tempo by without capturing with the d-pawn. Then, after White advances the e2 pawn to e3, without Black will have a hard time protecting the c4 pawn from the f1-Bishop's without attack. } 
e6 
{Capablanca declines the gambit. The d5-pawn is now protected and the dark- without square Bishop can get off of the first rank, but at a price! The without light-square Bishop is now blocked in! } 
4.Nc3 
{The other White Knight gets off the back rank and increases White's center  without control. Notice how playing the pawn to c4 before the Knight's move kept the without  c-pawn from being blocked in by the Knight. } 
Be7 
{Capa develops his Bishop, clears the deck for castling, and prevents White  without from pinning the Knight with Bg5. But see how Black's position is starting without to look a little cramped. He doesn't have much play for his without pieces. } 
5.Bg5 
{Janowski wants to push his pawn to e3 to release the light-square Bishop, but without doesn't want to block the dark-square Bishop in the process. With this move, without the Bishop develops usefully and doesn't get blocked after without e2-e3. } 
O-O 
{Capa gets his King out of the center and develops the Rook toward the center  without at the same time. The Rook may get some play there if the center opens up  without later.} 
6.e3 
{The light-square Bishop is free at last! The pawn also helps prop up the d4- without pawn. White's Queen controls two diagonals now, too (a4-d1 and without d1-h5). } 
Nbd7 
{The Knight develops and guards e5, keeping White's Knight from moving there. without Unfortunately, it also completely blocks the light-square Bishop. Now without Black's pieces are really cramped! } 
7.Rc1 
{Janowski is thinking ahead: he plans to trade off pawns with cxd5, which will without half-open the c-file. Open and half-open files are where rooks belong! Now without the Rook is in position to control the file as soon as the pawn swap is without complete. } 
c6 
{A second benefit of White's planned pawn trade is that he would then enjoy a  without 2-1 pawn superiority on the center files. Capablanca's move (c7-c6) ensures  without that he'll keep two pawns in the center too, and helps keep the game without balanced.} 
8.Bd3 
{Janowski finally develops his light-square Bishop. But Capablanca sees a way  without to make his opponent waste a tempo.} 
dxc4 
{The White Bishop is attacked and now Janowski must move it a second time without (thereby wasting a move and falling behind by a tempo). Making a move like  without this is like getting a free move to carry out your own plans. } 
9.Bxc4 
{Janowski had to recapture or else stay behind by a pawn. Either way, the  without Bishop was forced to move. Capablanca now has the initiative and can start without to work on uncramping (or "freeing") his game.} 
Nd5 
{Capa centralizes the Knight and uncovers an attack on the g5-Bishop from his without own Bishop on e7. Try to look for moves like this one in your own games, without moves that serve more than one purpose. } 
10.h4 
{Since the Bishop was attacked twice (by Queen and Bishop) and defended only without once (by the Knight), White must retreat, exchange, or protect the piece. without Unfortunately, Janowski's pawn push weakens his Kingside pawn structure.} 
f6 
{Looking ahead, Capablanca sees a way to open up the game and free his pieces. without He starts by attacking the Bishop a third time. The unfortunate side effect without of this move is that it blocks the Bishop along the d8-h4 diagonal. } 
11.Bf4 
{Janowski retreats his Bishop. Now Capablanca's eyes narrow as he continues without his plan to free his game while hanging on to the initiative. He needs a without move that forces a reply from White...}

Nb6 
{Capablanca hangs on to the initiative by making another threat (...Nb6xc4).  without He's also trying to maneuver the Knight to d5, right in the center, where it without  will control lots of space. } 
13.Bb3 
{Another forced reply. The Bishop moves out of danger and still manages to without keep the e6-pawn pinned. (Did you notice that the pawn can't advance because without of the White Bishop's potential check on the King?) } 
Nd5 
{Another multi-purpose move! The Knight breaks the pin, controls lots of without space, and attacks both the c3-Knight and the g4-pawn. Notice, too, how much without more scope Black has for his pieces, compared to a few moves without ago. } 
14.g3 
{If White plays Nc3xd5, he frees Black's pieces still further (check out the  without variation to move 14). Instead, he protects the threatened pawn. But look at without all of the weak light-colored squares on Janowski's Kingside! } 
( 14.Nxd5

13...Qe8 
{Capa shifts his Queen to the Kingside, planning to invade Janowski's position without via those weak light squares (Qe8-g6-g4). } 
15.Qd3 
{Janowski's King is still in the middle! He hasn't had time to castle because without he's done nothing but react to Black's threats since move 9! He tries to nip without  the latest one in the bud by Qd3, preventing Black from playing ...Qg6. without But... } 
Qh5 
{...Capa's Queen slides down to h5, where it can still get to the hole on g4! without However, since the move doesn't threaten anything directly, the pressure on without Janowski eases slightly. Maybe Janowski can grab back the initiative. } 
16.Bd1 
{With the Bishop move, Janowski sets up a future threat. If the Black Queen  without stays on the d1-h5 diagonal, White can (at a suitable moment) move his  without f3-Knight and uncover an attack by the Bishop against the Black without Queen. } 
Bb4 
{Capablanca strikes back on the other wing! He sets up a pin on the c3-Knight, without making sure that it can't capture Black's important centrally-placed Knight without on d5. } 
17.O-O 
{Janowski finally castles and removes the pin on his c3-Knight. But the area  without around his King is full of holes. If Capablanca can manage to get his light- without square Bishop into play, things will get ugly for White in a without hurry! } 
Bxc3 
{Surprise! Capa preserves his d5-Knight and grabs the initiative again by  without forcing White's reply (Janowski must take the Bishop or remain down a without piece).} 
18.bxc3 
{The only one of the three possible captures that doesn't lose material for  without White. Janowski's pawn structure is horrible. We see fine beads of sweat without begin to form on his forehead. Capa appears lost in thought...} 
Nxf4 
{WHAM! The crowd appears stunned. Doesn't this lose a Knight? Capablanca has without deliberately sacrificed it in order to open up more holes in White's without position. He also sees that this sacrifice almost assures a drawn game.} 
19.gxf4 
{Janowski must recapture or remain behind by a pawn. Also, if he doesn't take without the Knight, then he must move his Queen out of danger (from 19...Nf4xd3) without which costs him another tempo.} 
Qg4+ 
{Capa continues to direct the flow of play by checking White's King. Notice without how White had a potential attack on Black's Queen for several moves (from without the d1- Bishop) but Black gave him no time to move the f3-Knight. } 
20.Kh1 
{The only way to stop check is by moving the King (see the variation also). without Now the Queen can just keep moving back and forth between g4 and h3, without creating a draw by perpetual check. The players agree to a draw without here. } 
( 20.Kh2 
{This is the only move that Janowski had, other than the one actually played.} 
Qxf4+ 
{Notice the double attack--the Queen checks the King and attacks the Rook at  without the same time. After the White King moves, the c1-Rook is history (assuming, without  of course, that Black doesn't check again and get a draw by perpetual without check). } 
21.Kg1 
{Janowski would keep the King on a dark square, in order to avoid Black's without light-square Bishop. The King also protects the f1-Rook (you'll see why in a without moment). } 
Qxc1 
{Black snags the Rook. Although White's position looks like swiss cheese, his without pieces have more maneuvering room than do Black's.} 
22.Bc2 
{White uncorks a double threat. His Rook attacks the Queen, while he also without threatens Qxh7+, grabbing a free pawn. } 
Qh6 
{Black saves the Queen and stops the threat. The position is static, as without Black's pieces have less play than White's, but White has no obvious targets without to  attack. (Variation by Alekhine).}

Nf6 
{Reti's Knight leaps toward the center where, as you know, it will be well placed to take part in the action to come.} 
2.c4

3.g3 
{Alekhine will also fianchetto his Kingside Bishop. } 
Bg7 
{The Bishop moves to the long a1-h8 diagonal, from which it can easily influence the center.} 
4.Bg2

O-O

5.Nc3 
{Alekhine advances his Knight, a move he planned as far back as Move 2.} 
d6

6.Nf3 
{Alekhine continues to develop usefully, moving his Kingside Knight toward the center.} 
Nc6 
{All of the Knights are now developed to their natural center-controlling squares.} 
7.d5 
{Alekhine plays a move with several purposes: the pawn advance attacks the c6-Knight, it controls two squares deep in Black's territory, and it makes it harder for Black to break the center by advancing the c- or e-pawn.} 
Nb8 
{If Reti plays ...Ne5, Alekhine would counter with Nxe5. After ...dxe5, the doubled e5-pawn becomes a weak target. The move ...Na5 is possible, but encourages White to harass the Knight by advancing the Queenside pawns.} 
8.O-O 
{Satisfied with his space advantage and with Black's lack of immediate threats, Alekhine takes time to castle his King out of the center.} 
Bg4 
{Reti advances the Bishop, looking to trade it for White's Knight.} 
9.h3 
{Alekhine "puts the question" to the Bishop: either capture or retreat!} 
Bxf3 
{Reti swaps his Bishop for a Knight. But this exchange seems a little premature. With many pieces undeveloped and the position still somewhat unclear, it's a good idea to hang onto both Bishops until the position becomes better defined.} 
10.exf3 
{At first glance, this looks like it blocks the light-squared Bishop. But Alekhine has an idea...} 
e6 
{The old chess maxim says "When your position is cramped, free it by exchanging", which is exactly what Reti seeks to do here.} 
11.f4 
{Now we see the idea behind 10.exf3. The f4-pawn carves out space on the Kingside, the f1-Rook can slide over to e1 to command the e-file, and the light-squared Bishop on g2 once again controls the long diagonal.} 
exd5 
{Reti clears some space by swapping center pawns. His eventual goal is to plant a Knight on c6.} 
12.cxd5 
{Alekhine, of course, completes the swap, leaving him with an isolated pawn on d5.} 
c5 
{Reti really isn't too concerned with making the d5-pawn a target. The fact that he has a pawn on d6, directly in front of the isolated White pawn, means that the White pawn will be hard to attack anyway (the Rooks and Queen can't get at it along the d-file). So Reti advances his c-pawn, inviting White to capture en passant.} 
13.dxc6 
{The rules for en passant capture state that it must be done immediately or not at all, so Alekhine snaps up the pawn.} 
Nxc6 
{And Reti has his second Knight out. But his d-pawn is now isolated (plus it's advanced only one square), so it may become a liability later.} 
14.Be3 
{Alekhine develops his last minor piece. 14.Bd2 was out of the question, as the Bishop would then block the Queen's influence along the d-file.} 
Qd7

{Alekhine completes his development by pinning the c6-Knight (should the Knight move, the Black Queen is hanging undefended. Notice, though, that the c3-Knight guards the White Queen). } 
Rac8 
{Rooks belong on open files, as the old adage says.} 
16.Rad1 
{White puts pressure on the d6-pawn as well as indirectly attacks the Black Queen (by pinning the pawn). Alekhine is planning Bc5, piling up on the d6-pawn (...dxc5 would be impossible due to the reply Rxd7). } 
b6 
{Reti keeps the White Bishop off of c5 by controlling the square with a pawn. } 
17.b3 
{Alekhine overprotects the Queen. Both the b3-pawn and the c3-Knight defend the Queen; now either one of them is free for another duty should the need arise.} 
Rfd8 
{Reti adds another defender to the d6-pawn, in anticipation of White's Nb5 (which would attack the pawn).} 
18.Rd3 
{Alekhine clears d1 for the second Roook. He plans to double the Rooks on the d-file and put further pressure on the d6-pawn.} 
Ne7 
{Reti's thought here is to relieve some of the pressure on his center by swapping off the Queens.} 
19.Nb5 
{Alekhine will have none of it. He deftly blocks the Queen swap and adds another attacker to the push against d6. } 
d5 
{Sometimes the best way to defend a threatened pawn is to advance it. Rather than scramble to find another defender for the pawn, Reti advances it to a square already controlled by four of his pieces. Now the pawn is attacked just once and securely overprotected. } 
20.Nxa7 
{Alekhine begins operations against Black's Queenside pawns, which will quickly melt away.} 
Ra8 
{Pinning the White Knight. Even if the White Queens moves, Black still thrusts at the a2-pawn with an x-ray attack. Unfortunately, the Rook must abandon the open c-file to make this possible. }

21.bxa4 
{The obvious recapture.} 
Rc2 
{The Rook slides down the open file to attack the a2-pawn.} 
22.Bxb6

{Alekhine must recapture. Compare this board position to the one after 22.Bxb6 in the last variation we looked at. The positions are identical save for one Black Rook, which is on a8 here, as opposed to c2 in the variation. The Rook would have better chances of winning a pawn if it was on c2 than it does at its present post. This is why 20...Qxa4 was better.}

Ra6 
{Reti retreats the Rook with a threat to the b6-Bishop. }

{Reti is intending to play ...Ra5, so the Knight advances to provide coverage for that square. } 
28.Nc3 
{Alekhine replies by putting pressure on the isolated pawn. } 
Ra5 
{Reti attacks the hanging Bishop. The idea is to force the Bishop to move so that the a5-Rook will help defend the d-pawn. But this seems a bit awkward.} 
29.Bb6 
{The Bishop moves (of course) but to a square from which it threatens the a5-Rook. } 
Ra6 
{The Rook creates another threat to the Bishop. By keeping White off-balance this way, Reti doesn't give his opponent time to capture the isolated pawn.}

30.Bc5 
{Alekhine merely moves the Bishop back to its former post.} 
Ra5 
{Reti, a pawn down, is only too happy to repeat the position.}

32.Rd2 
{The Rook must withdraw.} 
h6 
{Having done all he can on the Queenside, Reti now turns his attention to the Kingside.} 
33.a4 
{Alekhine advances the pawn, taking space away from the a5-Rook (the pawn is guarded by the Knight on c3).} 
Ne4 
{Reti sees a way to try to improve his position. He begins by attacking the Rook on d2. } 
34.Nxe4 
{The Knight swap is forced, as White has no way to save both the Rook and the c3-Knight.} 
dxe4 
{The obvious conclusion to the trade.} 
35.Rd8+ 
{Alekhine picks up a tempo by attacking the King.} 
Kh7 
{Moving the King to safety is better than ...Bf8 as the latter move just pins the Bishop.} 
36.Bxe4 
{Alekhine snares the hanging pawn...} 
Rxa4 
{...and Reti returns the favor. The idea of these exchanges was to eliminate the central and Queenside pawns. Now Reti's Knight will be as valuable as a Bishop in an endgame with pawns on just one side of the board. Now his problem is how to get his Knight back across the board.}

{Alekhine picks at the pawns around the White King. There is now a threat of mate: hxg6!} 
Rxh5 
{It was either this or the awful ...Bf6.} 
42.Bg5 
{And now the Black Rook is cut off.} 
Bc3 
{Reti gives his King a bit of breathing room, but it's a pretty hopeless situation. Black could resign here.} 
43.Rd7+ 
{By checking the King, Alekhine forces it to the back rank.} 
Kg8 
{...Kh8 was also possible, though iy would hardly make a difference.}

1.d4 
{Alekhine (White) opens with 1.d4, a good center-controlling move that will without probably lead to a game of maneuver.} 
Nf6 
{Marshall (Black) keeps his options open regarding the placement of his center without pawns. He may yet choose to occupy the center with his pawns, or he may without allow White to occupy the center, so that Black can attack it from the without flanks.} 
2.c4 
{Alekhine advances a flank pawn, but this pawn still controls some of the without center. The fifth-rank squares b5 through e5 are all under White's control.} 
d6 
{This d-pawn advance prevents further encroachment by the White c-pawn and without releases the Black light-squared Bishop.} 
3.Nc3 
{We see now the other reason for 2.c4. Alekhine wanted to develop this Knight without to c3 without imprisoning the c-pawn.} 
g6 
{The g-pawn advances to allow Marshall to fianchetto his Bishop to g7 (where without it will command the long a1-h8 diagonal).} 
4.e4 
{Alekhine continues his campaign to dominate the center. The e-pawn advances without under the c3-Knight's watchful eye.} 
Bg7 
{The Bishop is well-posted on the long diagonal. Marshall can now complete his without Kingside development by castling.} 
5.f4 
{WOW! Look at White's phalanx of center pawns! These pawns control Black's without fourth rank from b5 to g5!} 
O-O 
{Marshall gets his King out of the center. Now he can concentrate on without developing his Queenside.} 
6.Nf3 
{Alekhine has again developed a Knight without blocking in a pawn.} 
Bg4 
{Marshall pins the Knight that Alekhine has just developed.} 
7.Be2 
{And Alekhine develops another piece, breaking the pin at the same time.} 
Nc6 
{Marshall develops his last minor piece. Now he's just a move away from without connecting his Rooks and completing his development. But 7...Nbd7 may have without been better because of...} 
8.d5 
{...this! By advancing the pawn, White grabs a nice chunk of Black's half of without the board while chasing the newly-developed Black Knight.} 
Nb8 
{Marshall must retreat the Knight. He's now wasted two tempi with nothing to without show for it.} 
9.O-O 
{Alekhine can afford the luxury of castling, since Black has just effectively without wasted two moves.} 
Nbd7 
{Marshall now does what he should have done in the first place: he develops without the Knight to d7.} 
10.Ng5 
{Alekhine decides to clarify the whole Bishop situation, offering his "bad" without Bishop in exchange for Black's Bishop on g4.} 
Bxe2 
{Marshall has no choice. The Bishop has no good retreat square (10...Bh5 without 11.Bxh5 gxh5 gives Black weak doubled h-pawns, while 11...Nxh5 posts the without Knight on the board's edge).} 
11.Qxe2 
{Of course, Alekhine must make this recapture to even the material balance.} 
h6 
{Marshall doesn't want the Knight so close to his King's castled position, so without he kicks the Knight out.} 
12.Nf3 
{Alekhine retreats the Knight, but he's succeeded in his goal of trading off without his bad Bishop for one of Black's Bishops.} 
e6 
{Marshall challenges the White d-pawn. If White replies dxe6, then Black will without have a 2-1 central pawn majority after Black replies ...fxe6.} 
13.e5 
{Instead of dxe6, Alekhine counterattacks by advancing his e-pawn. Black must without either capture the e-pawn or waste a tempo by retreating the Knight.} 
dxe5 
{Marshall captures...} 
14.fxe5 
{...and Alekhine recaptures. White now has a 2-1 central pawn majority, and without the Black Knight must move anyway!} 
Ng4 
{Rather than meekly retreating to e8, the Knight aggressively advances toward without White's Kingside.} 
15.Bf4 
{Alekhine completes his development, connects his Rooks, and protects his without e-pawn.} 
exd5 
{Marshall captures the d-pawn in order to open up the e-file. Next he'll move without the Rook to e8, pinning the White e-pawn.} 
16.e6 
{Alekhine advances the pawn and attacks the Knight...} 
Re8 
{...and Marshall pins the pawn to the Queen.} 
17.exf7+ 
{Surprise! How can Alekhine do this? Because he captures the f-pawn WITH without CHECK! Stopping check takes precedence over ...Rxe2.} 
Kxf7 
{Marshall must capture the pawn; if 17...Kf8 18.fxe8=Q Qxe8 19.Qxe8 Kxe8 and without Black is down a Rook.} 
18.Qd2 
{Because Black had to get out of check, Alekhine has time to save his Queen.} 
Ndf6 
{Marshall clears the Knight off of the d-file. He plans to win a pawn with without ...dxc4 (when White must either move or guard his Queen).} 
19.cxd5 
{Alekhine beats him to the punch, making the material balance even once again. without But the White d-pawn is now isolated and could become weak.} 
g5 
{Marshall expands on the Kingside and attacks the White Bishop.} 
20.Bg3 
{By dropping back to g3 (instead of retreating along the c1-h6 diagonal) the without Bishop controls the square in front of the d-pawn, as well as poses a without possible threat to the Black c7-pawn.} 
Qe7 
{Since his King is so exposed, Marshall would feel safer with the Queens off without of the board. He plans to play 21...Qe3+, forcing 22.Qxe3 Nxe3.} 
21.Kh1 
{Alekhine sees Marshall's intent and slides his King into the corner. Now without ...Qe3 is still possible, but no longer forces a Queen exchange.} 
Kg8 
{Marshall backs his King up toward the relative safety of the corner, making without sure to stay on light squares (since White has no light-squared Bishop).} 
22.Rfe1 
{Alekhine siezes the initiative by attacking the Black Queen.} 
Qc5 
{Marshall saves his Queen by retreating it off of the e-file. Why ...Qc5? The without Black Queen maintains control of g1, making the White King a prisoner in the without corner.} 
23.Re6 
{Having an isolated d-pawn can sometimes have advantages as well as drawbacks. without One advantage is that the pawn frequently provides you with outpost squares without on your opponent's half of the board.} 
Rad8 
{Even if the file is only half-open, it's often a good idea to place a Rook on without the same file as the enemy Queen. The pin on the pawn may later prove to without have great value.} 
24.Qe2 
{Alekhine prevents Black from capturing the d-pawn with his Knight (24...Nxd5 without 25.Rxe8+ Rxe8 26.Qxe8+, winning a Rook for a pawn). This also takes the without sting out of a Rook capture of the d-pawn.} 
Kh8 
{Marshall corners his King to prepare for an exchange of Rooks on e6. (If the without King doesn't abandon g8, then 25...Rxe6 26.Qxe6+ and White has the without initiative)} 
25.h3 
{Unfortunately for Black, he hasn't noticed that his g4-Knight is trapped! without Alekhine's pawn advances to show Marshall the error of his ways.} 
Rxe6 
{Marshall sidetracks White by capturing his Rook.} 
26.dxe6 
{There's no advantage to Qxe6 (now that the Black King has moved) and the pawn without on d5 is indefensible. Alekhine, by capturing with the pawn, moves it over without to the e-file, where it's no longer attacked and is covered by the Queen.} 
Nh5 
{Marshall appears unconcerned about his threatened Knight on g4. Instead, he without counterattacks by striking at the White Bishop.} 
27.Ne4 
{Instead of moving the Bishop, Alekhine elects to guard it and attack the without Black Queen at the same time!} 
Qc6 
{Marshall has to save the Queen.} 
28.Bxc7 
{Now Alekhine sees a way to win a pawn -- by first sacrificing his Bishop! But without it's only a sham sacrifice, as we'll soon see.} 
Qxc7 
{Marshall captures the Bishop (of course, or else White will play 29.Bxd8!).} 
29.hxg4 
{The Knight has been up for grabs for several moves, but only now does without Alekhine take it. Don't just capture automatically; always look around in without case there are better moves that win more material or gain you a big without advantage.} 
Nf4 
{The endangered Black Knight leaps forward to fork the White Queen and e-pawn.} 
30.Qe1 
{Of course, the Queen is more valuable than the pawn, so Alekhine must save without it.} 
Nxe6 
{And Marshall bags the pawn. It seems that 28.Bxc7 wasn't such a good move without after all. Though the material count is even, Marshall has the advantage of without owning a Bishop, and Alekhine is stuck with doubled g-pawns.} 
31.Ng3 
{Alekhine pulls his Knight back to g3. From here it can jump to a outpost on without either f5 or h5.} 
Nf4 
{The outpost idea has occurred to Marshall, too. His Knight takes up residence without on f4.} 
32.Rd1 
{Normally, exchanging pieces when you're at a disadvantage is a bad idea. So without why does Alekhine offer a Rook swap? He sees a way to drive his Queen into without the enemy position and harass the Black King...} 
Rxd1 
{Marshall sees no reason to refuse the trade.} 
33.Qxd1 
{Alekhine recaptures (of course, he had no choice anyway!).} 
Bxb2 
{Marshall grabs a pawn and increases his advantage.} 
34.Qa4 
{Alekhine's Queen has two possible destinations: a7 (taking back the pawn) or without e8 (annoying the Black King).} 
Bg7 
{Marshall brings the Bishop back to the Kingside because 1) it's safer there without than hanging out there on b2; 2) it may be needed for the defense of the without King.} 
35.Qe8+ 
{And now Alekhine's Queen becomes annoying to Black.} 
Kh7 
{The only sensible way to get out of check.} 
36.Qe4+ 
{The Queen continues its pesky ways.} 
Ng6 
{Marshall must either block the check or face a draw by repetition. His Knight without is forced to leave its f4 outpost square.} 
37.Nh5 
{Alekhine continues his harassment tactics, this time attacking Black's without Bishop.} 
Qc1+ 
{But this gives Marshall time to engage in a little harassment of his own!} 
38.Kh2 
{There were several ways to block the check, but Alekhine decides that moving without the King is the best course.} 
Qc6 
{Marshall offers a Queen trade, hoping to gain a passed pawn (39.Qxc6 bxc6).} 
39.Qd3 
{Alekhine refuses to cooperate. He merely withdraws the Queen while without maintaining the pin on the Black Knight.} 
Qc7+ 
{Another check. Marshall has to make his 45th move by the end of the third without hour of play (a time that is fast approaching). He makes an annoyance check without to buy time on the clock while he considers his options.} 
40.Kh1 
{By retreating the King to h1, Alekhine welcomes 40...Qc1+ and a possible draw without by perpetual check. Alekhine has no problem with taking a draw in an without inferior position.} 
Bh8 
{Marshall isn't ready to entertain the thought of a draw. He decides instead without to preserve his threatened Bishop (which was attacked by the h5-Knight, without remember?).} 
41.Qe4 
{Now it's Alekhine's turn to stall. Qe4 doesn't really help his game, but it's without not hurting it, either.} 
Qc1+ 
{Since the Bishop has been moved to h8, it's safe for the Queen to check again without without fear of repeating the position.} 
42.Kh2 
{The King retreats again...} 
Qc7+ 
{...and the Queen checks again. Now each player has to make just three moves without by the end of the third hour (this is called "making the time control"). The without time control for this tournament is fifteen moves an hour.} 
43.Kh1 
{Alekhine invites another Queen check...} 
Qf7 
{...but Marshall has something else in mind. He attacks the a-pawn! Capturing without it would give him connected passed pawns on the Queenside (which would be without very hard to stop from promoting).} 
44.Qc2 
{Alekhine defends the a-pawn while retaining the pin on the Black Knight.} 
b5 
{Marshall decides that the time is right to activate his Queenside pawns without (since the Kingside is pretty much locked up).} 
45.Qc6 
{The White Queen attacks the b-pawn (which can't be defended by the a-pawn without because of Qxa6).} 
b4 
{The b-pawn is forced to advance far ahead of its partner on the a-file (which without is exactly what White wants).} 
46.Ng3 
{Alekhine plans to relocate the Knight to f5, which is a much better square without (since it's not on the edge of the board and close to the center).} 
Qxa2 
{The Queen kills White's remaining Queenside pawn. Now Marshall has a pair of without connected passed pawns. But will he be able to promote one?} 
47.Qb7+ 
{Not likely, as the White Queen double-attacks the King and b-pawn.} 
Bg7 
{Marshall blocks the check (a move that also puts his Bishop into a pin).} 
48.Nf5 
{Uh-oh! Alekhine threatens Qxg7 mate! What will Marshall do?} 
Qa1+ 
{Marshall's Queen comes to the rescue by defending the attacked Bishop (and without checking White at the same time!).} 
49.Kh2 
{The White King ducks into the pocket.} 
Qf6 
{The Queen moves to f6 where it has a dual role: defending the Kingside and without covering the advance of the a-pawn to a6.} 
50.Qxa7 
{Alekhine surprises everyone by snapping off the a-pawn instead of grabbing without the more advanced b-pawn.} 
b3 
{Marshall advances his sole remaining passed pawn, knowing that it can reach without the protected b2-square before White has the chance to attack it.} 
51.Qb7 
{Alekhine can't stop the pawn from reaching the safe haven of b2, but putting without the Queen on the b-file prevents the pawn from advancing further to b1.} 
b2 
{The pawn reaches the safety of b2 (where it's defended by the Black Queen).} 
52.N3d4 
{One of the White Knights (defended by its brother) cuts off the b-pawn's without protection from the Queen.} 
Ne5 
{Marshall sighs. He sees that the b-pawn is lost. Suddenly, his face without brightens. "An eye for an eye," he thinks, as he attacks the g4-pawn with without his Knight.} 
53.Qxb2 
{Alekhine kills the b-pawn (in the nick of time, since it was just one square without away from becoming a new Queen!).} 
Nxg4+ 
{Marshall nails the g-pawn and checks the White King.} 
54.Kh3 
{The King moves out of check and turns the tables on its assailant.} 
Qe5 
{Marshall comes up with a deadly threat -- ...Qh2 mate!} 
55.g3 
{The pawn advances and blocks h2 off from the Black Queen.} 
Qe4 
{The Black Queen advances and defends the menaced Knight. Notice, too, that without the Bishop pins the d4-Knight to the White Queen, which leaves the f5-Knight without defenseless from the Black Queen's attack.} 
56.Qc2 
{Alekhine, a pawn down, hates to offer a Queen trade, but it's the only way to without keep from losing one of his Knights outright.} 
Qxc2 
{Marshall, in a superior position (with a Bishop vs. a Knight and an extra without pawn) gladly makes the trade.} 
57.Nxc2 
{Alekhine completes the trade. The New York crowd is on the edge of their without seats. Can their hometown hero slay the "Grandmonster of Chess"?} 
h5 
{Marshall advances the pawn to defend his Knight from the White King's attack.} 
58.Nce3 
{Alekhine offers another trade! This time it's a Knight swap! Why? We'll see without in a minute.} 
Nxe3 
{Marshall grabs the Knight...} 
59.Nxe3 
{...and Alekhine recaptures. He knows that Knights are better than Bishops in without endgames with pawns on only one side of the board. Why? Because Knights are without able to operate on squares of BOTH colors.} 
Bd4 
{The Bishop needs to play a more active role, so Marshall uses it to attack without the White Knight.} 
60.Nf5 
{Turnabout is fair play! The Knight moves out of danger and attacks the without Bishop.} 
Bc5 
{By backing off to c5, the Bishop severely cuts down the Knight's mobility. without All seven of the squares that the Knight can move to are guarded by Black without pieces!} 
61.g4 
{Alekhine doesn't have much choice. His best plan is to try to trade off a without pair of pawns and deal with Black's remaining pawn as best he can. The without Knight also has a square to move to now (g3).} 
Kg6 
{Rather than trade off the pawns, Marshall chooses to prevent a pawn swap (if without White plays gxh5, the Knight is lost and Black can easily destroy the White without pawn before it promotes).} 
62.Nh4+ 
{Alekhine temps Black to play gxh4 to stop the check, after which the pawns without are liquidated and the game is drawn. If Black plays ...Kh6, White can draw without by perpetual check. The players agree to end hostilities and the game is without drawn.}

1.d4 
{Marshall (White) starts with a good opening pawn move. He now controls both without c5 and e5 and he releases the dark-square Bishop. } 
Nf6 
{Reti (Black) counters by developing the Knight to its best opening square. By without doing so, he also keeps his choice of opening a secret to White, who doesn't without know if Black will develop his Bishops through the center or the flanks.} 
2.Nf3 
{White develops the Knight toward the center, controls d4, and strengthens his without grip on e5. } 
g6 
{Now Marshall knows that Reti intends to develop the f8-Bishop by without fianchettoing it to g7. } 
3.c4 
{This pawn advance carves out some more of the center for White. Also, the b1- without Knight can develop to c3 without blocking the c-pawn, and the Queen has the without option to develop along the a4-d1 diagonal. } 
Bg7 
{In the Hypermodern style, Reti chooses to attack White's center from the without flank rather than fight it out in the center with his d- and e-pawns. Once without the f6- Knight moves, the Bishop will attack White's d4-pawn.} 
4.Nc3 
{Marshall gets the other Knight off of the back rank and into the game. Notice without how his pieces and pawns exercise control over all four center squares without (d4,e4, d5,e5). } 
O-O 
{Reti completes his Kingside development. Now his King is safely tucked away without and his Rook is developed toward the important center files.} 
5.e4 
{Since Reti is allowing him to develop in the center, Marshall builds up an without imposing pawn phalanx by advancing the e-pawn.} 
d6 
{This pawn advance prevents White from advancing either his Knight or pawn to without e5, prepares for a possible later e7-e5 pawn push for Black, and releases without the  c8-Bishop from captivity. } 
6.Bd3 
{Marshall develops his light-square Bishop and gets ready to castle. But the without Bishop blocks the Queen's protection of the d4-pawn, which weakens the pawn without slightly. Perhaps 6.Be2 might have been better.} 
( 6.Be2 
{This looks a little better than what was actually played by Marshall. It's without heartening to know that even the greats slip up once in a while! Maybe now without we won't be so hard on ourselves when we make mistakes in our own games!} 
) 
5...Bg4 
{Reti's keen eye spots the d4-pawn's weakness and siezes the moment to exploit without it by pinning the f3-Knight. Now the poor pawn is totally unprotected! White without is forced to expend a tempo to protect it, or else... } 
7.h3 
{...drive the Bishop away. Now the Bishop is forced to either withdraw or  without capture the Knight. This pawn attack is called "putting the question to the  without Bishop".} 
Bxf3 
{Reti decides to trade his Bishop for the Knight, insuring that the d4-pawn  without will remain weak and unprotected, at least for a while.} 
8.Qxf3 
{Marshall recaptures with the Queen, developing it in the process. This is without much better than doubling up pawns on the f-file with 8.gxf3. But now the without d-pawn stands alone...} 
( 8.gxf3 
{The f-pawns and h3-pawn are weak because they can't be defended by other  without pawns. Black should now shift his attack to the Kingside to exploit the without half- open g-file and the weak pawns. } 
) 
7...Nfd7 
{...so Reti unleashes a discovered attack against it (from the g7-Bishop). without Despite the fact that he lags behind in development, Black still controls without the game by continuing to make threats which must be answered by without White. } 
9.Be3 
{Marshall protects the weak pawn and usefully develops his last minor piece at without the same time.} 
c5 
{Reti hits the weak pawn a second time. How in the world will Marshall defend without it now?} 
10.d5 
{He defends the pawn by advancing it! Now it's amply protected by two fellow without pawns and a Knight. At the same time he grabs more space on Black's side of without the board. Now c6 and e6 are unusable by Black. } 
Ne5 
{The Knight leaps ahead and forks the Queen and light-square Bishop. See how without Reti continues to make threats and keep the initiative. } 
11.Qe2 
{The White Queen retreats and simultaneously protects the menaced without d3-Bishop. } 
Nxd3+ 
{Reti hates to trade his well-posted Knight for Marshall's bad Bishop. But if without he doesn't, Marshall will play f2-f4 and drive the Knight back to d7, where without it becomes ineffective.} 
12.Qxd3 
{The Queen recaptures, but now it's not well-placed. See how the c4 and e4 without pawns block the Queen. Meanwhile, look at how much scope Reti's g7-Bishop is without  getting along the a1-h8 diagonal! Even though White's Queen and Black's without Bishop control the same number of spaces, the Bishop controls squares that without are much more important. } 
Nd7 
{Reti develops his remaining Knight. Obviously, he's thinking about advancing  without it to e5. } 
13.O-O 
{Now that Reti has eased up the pressure, Marshall decides that this is a good without time to get his King out of the center. White's King is protected and his  without Rooks are connected on the first rank (and can support each without other). } 
Qa5 
{Reti's idea is to try to win a pawn: after ...Ne5, White's Queen must move without and can't protect both c3 and c4. Depending on which square White leaves without unguarded Black will either play ...Nxc4 or exchange his Bishop for a Knight without and pawn. } 
14.Bd2 
{Now c3 is defended by the Bishop. If Black plays ...Ne5, the White Queen can without retreat to e2 and White's position holds. Also, if the White Knight moves, without it uncovers an attack by the d2-Bishop against the Black Queen. } 
a6 
{Black can't prevent the discovered attack, but he can keep the White Knight without out of his territory. The a-pawn advances, denying the square b5 to the without White Knight. } 
15.Nd1 
{Predictably, Marshall uncorks the discovered attack against the Black Queen. without He also sets up a threat against Black's powerful Bishop. We'll see that without threat next move. } 
Qc7 
{Reti has to retreat the Queen. None of the available retreat squares are very without good, but c7 is the least of the evils. On b6 the Queen takes a square away without from the d7-Knight, and on d8 it blocks communication between the without Rooks. } 
16.Bc3 
{White challenges Black's domination of the a1-h8 diagonal. Marshall hopes without that Reti will decide to exchange the Bishops, thereby easing the pressure without on White's Queenside.} 
Ne5 
{Reti pulls a rabbit out of his hat. The Knight blocks the exchange of Bishops without and menaces the White Queen as well. } 
17.Qe2 
{Marshall's Queen drops back to the only square where it still protects the without weak pawn on c4. } 
b5 
{Reti offers to sacrifice a pawn in an effort to open up the a and b-files for without his Rooks. Black's Bishop already pressures White's Queenside, and the Rooks without on a8 and b8 will increase the pressure.} 
18.cxb5 
{Marshall accepts the sacrifice. Now the White Queen is no longer chained to without the defense of c4. Marshall feels that the Queen's increased freedom will without offset Black's Queenside pressure.} 
axb5 
{Black recaptures, expecting White to reply 19.Qxb5. Then Black will move a without Rook to b8, drive away the White Queen, and grab the initiative. } 
19.f4 
{Marshall surprises Reti by attacking the strong, centrally-placed Knight without instead of capturing the b5-pawn.} 
Nc4 
{Reti springs a surprise of his own. The Knight is still well-placed on c4, without and it blocks the capture of the Black b5-pawn. But the exchange of Bishops without can't be prevented now.} 
20.Bxg7 
{Marshall finally has his way concerning the powerful Black Bishop. Now Reti without is forced to recapture to keep the material even. This hands the initiative without to Marshall.} 
Kxg7 
{Reti makes the neccessary recapture. Black's King is now slightly exposed and without White has the initiative. What will Marshall decide to do?} 
21.Nc3 
{Marshall gets his Knight back into the game and re-connects his Rooks. The without Knight has gone from a poor position on d1 to a better post on c3 where it without attacks Black's b5-pawn. } 
Qa5 
{Reti makes sure that his Knight will stay posted on b4, by making the pawn without push b2-b3 extremely unattractive to White (22.b3 Qxc3 23.bxc4 bxc4 and without Black is a pawn ahead or else 23...b4, where Black gets a cramping pawn without chain).} 
22.a4 
{Marshall prepares a future a4xb5, which removes the c4-Knight's immediate without protection, and discovers an attack by the a1-Rook against the Black without Queen. } 
( 22.b3 
{Here's what happens in the variation given in the text to Black's 21st move. without White begins by attacking the Black Knight.} 
Qxc3 
{Black, rather than retreat his Knight, snatches White's unprotected Knight without instead.} 
23.bxc4 
{White makes the material even by grabbing Black's Knight.} 
bxc4 
{In this sub-variation, Black takes the White c4-pawn. Although Black is now a without  pawn ahead, he'll be hard-pressed to maintain his advantage. The doubled  without pawns are weak, and the Black c4-pawn could easily become a target. } 
( 22...b4 
{This sub-variation is probably better than 23...bxc4. Here Black obtains a without pawn chain from b4 to d6 that controls a lot of space and inhibits the without movement of White's heavy pieces. } 
) ) 
21...Qb4 
{Rather than retreat, the Black Queen stays in the thick of the fight. Now the without White b2-pawn is attacked twice (by Black's Queen and Knight) and defended without only once. } 
23.Nxb5 
{Instead of defending the b2-pawn, Marshall decides that now is a good time to without snatch one of Black's pawns. What will Reti do now? Maybe grab a pawn for without himself with 23...Nxb2? } 
Rxa4 
{Surprise! Black's Rook comes crashing into the fight! Reti feels that White's without passed a-pawn could be dangerous later, so he keeps up the attack by killing without the pawn and getting the Rook into the game.} 
24.Rxa4 
{Swapping off the Rooks eases the pressure on White's threatened b2-pawn.} 
Qxa4 
{Black could have taken the Knight, but then he would have been behind by the without Exchange (down a Rook for a Knight). By capturing the Rook, Black keeps the without material even.} 
25.Rc1 
{Rather than retreat his Knight, Marshall opts to trade it for Black's Knight. without Now, if Reti plays 25...Qxb5, Marshall can reply 26.Rxc4, as his Rook will without be protected by his Queen.} 
Qxb5 
{Reti captures the Knight as expected. He could also have retreated his own without Knight, but he prefers the exchange of pieces.} 
26.Rxc4 
{Marshall completes the piece swap. Now the ball is in Reti's court. What will without he do?} 
Rb8 
{Reti makes another threat. This time he threatens to win a pawn and invade without White's position with 27...Qxb2 28.Qxb2 Rxb2. } 
27.Rc2 
{Obviously. This was Marshall's only way to save the pawn. Now Reti can force without the exchange of Queens...} 
Qxe2 
{...which he does. Now Marshall must take with the Rook or be a whole Queen without behind (an overwhelming material disadvantage). See how Reti controls the without initiative by making moves that force a reply from White.} 
28.Rxe2 
{The material is even, but Marshall is now stuck with an isolated pawn on b2. without This pawn is very weak. Its weakness stems from the fact that there are no without pawns on adjacent files to help defend it. } 
Rb4 
{The Black Rook advances to an outpost where it's protected by the c-pawn and without menaces two White pawns (b2 and e4). This ties up Marshall and restricts his without freedom of action, for if the e2-Rook moves, one of the pawns must without fall. } 
29.Kf2 
{The White King begins its march to reach a square where it can protect one of without the threatened pawns.} 
Kf8 
{Reti begins to swing his King around to the Queenside. From there, it can without either maneuver to attack White's pawns or support the advance of Black's.} 
30.Kf3 
{The White King reaches a square where it defends the e4-pawn.} 
Rd4 
{The Rook shifts position to another square where the c5-pawn still defends without it. It also sets up an "invisible barrier" on the d-file which White's King without cannot enter or cross. } 
31.g4 
{Since his activity is now limited on the Queenside, Marshall advances his without g-pawn to grab more space on the Kingside.} 
Ke8 
{Reti has a choice of two plans: to counterattack with his Kingside pawns or without continue to maneuver his King toward the Queenside. He chooses the latter.} 
32.Re3 
{Since the b2-pawn is no longer threatened, Marshall is free to prepare a without counterattack by moving his Rook.} 
Rb4 
{Reti's Rook returns to b4 and attacks the pawn again. } 
33.Ra3 
{Marshall, tired of being tied to defense, decides to abandon the pawn and set without up an annoying series of checks against the Black King.} 
Rxb2 
{Reti wins a pawn, but allows Marshall to counterattack with the Rook.} 
34.Ra8+ 
{Marshall checks Black's King and drives it off of the back rank.} 
Kd7 
{The Black King flees to the only possible square. Will Marshall decide to without check again, or will he attack the Black Kingside pawns with his Rook?} 
35.Ra7+ 
{Marshall maintains the pressure by checking again.} 
Kd8 
{The King escapes check and continues to protect the e7-pawn.} 
36.e5 
{The White e-pawn advances, forcing Black to capture it (if Black doesn't, without then White plays 37.exd6 exd6 38.Rxf7 and wins a pawn). } 
dxe5 
{Now Black is stuck with a weak, isolated pawn on c5. } 
37.fxe5 
{White recaptures to complete the pawn swap. Now, if the White Rook moves, the without squares c6,d6,e6, and f6 are covered by White's pawns and are denied to without Black's King. } 
c4 
{Reti hopes to strengthen the pawn by advancing it to a square where it is without easily defended by the Rook. Also, remember that a passed pawn becomes more without dangerous the closer it gets to the promotion square.} 
38.Ke3 
{A centrally-posted King is a distinct advantage in the endgame. Marshall without moves his King toward the center, where it can move to the Quenside to help without attack Black's pawn, or to the Kingside to help prevent a Black pawn without breakthrough.} 
c3 
{The Black pawn continues its march toward either coronation or death.} 
39.Ra8+ 
{The passed c-pawn is a dangerous threat; if it manages to promote to a Queen, without White's a dead duck. Marshall is trying for a draw by perpetual check.} 
Kc7 
{The Black King obviously must move to escape check.} 
40.Ra7+ 
{Another check...} 
Kd8 
{...and another evasion. The Black King must come back to d8 or else the without e7-pawn is lost. }

Kc7 
{The King must move again.} 
42.Ra7+ 
{Marshall again hopes to repeat the position...} 
Rb7 
{But Reti will not draw quietly! He offers to exchange Rooks, forcing Marshall without to work for the draw.} 
43.Ra3 
{Marshall surprises Reti with this move. The Rook attacks Black's passed pawn without (which cannot now be defended!).} 
c2 
{Reti pushes the pawn, but to no avail. The pawn is marked for death.} 
44.Rc3+ 
{Marshall springs a double attack (checking the King and attacking the pawn). without This assures the pawn's sad demise. } 
Kd7 
{The Black King shuttles sideways toward its own pawns, in order to help without protect them or aid in their later advance.} 
45.Rxc2 
{Black's passed pawn finally gives up the ghost.} 
Rb3+ 
{Reti wins a pawn using a basic tactic: the skewer, or x-ray attack. The White without King must move out of check, after which the Black Rook pockets the without h3-pawn. } 
46.Kd4 
{The best place for White's King to move to. Now the King supports both of without White's center pawns.} 
Rxh3 
{Reti snatches the h-pawn. Now Black is a pawn ahead, and may have chances of without creating another passed pawn.} 
47.Ra2 
{Since he's a pawn behind, Marshall sees slight chance of winning the game. He without again maneuvers for a draw by repetition or perpetual check.} 
Rg3 
{Reti could have played 47...Rb3 instead (trying to get into position to offer without a Rook exchange like on move 42), but he decides to capture White's without g-pawn. }
