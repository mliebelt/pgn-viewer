French Defence
Wilhelm Steinitz, the great German Chess Master was officially recognized as the first World Chess Champion after he defeated Johannes Zukertort in 1886 in a 20 games match. Steinitz laid the basis for the scientific theory of chess. He paid much attention to weak and strong points and the accumulation of small positional advantages. He clearly revealed the flaws of premature attack and made the most of the slightest weakening of a position. He is the author of numerous studies dealing with chess theory. His Modern Chess Instructor (1889) greatly influenced the further development of chess theory.

Emannuel Lasker became the second World Champion by defeating Steinitz in 1894. He held the crown longer than anyone else (26years and 337 days) defending it in a number of matches. Lasker, a man with doctorates in Mathematics and Philosophy, was a subtle psychologist and possessed exceptional competitive traits and will power. He retained his playing strength until old age. At the age of 67, he took part in an international tournament at Moscow, where he was placed third, ahead of many leading players of that time. His books 'Common Sense in Chess' and 'Chess Manual' were published in many languages.

Black plays this move to exchange his Bishop for White Knight, breaking up White's King-side Pawns. However, after this exchange White will have an effective Pawn majority on the King-side against Black's ineffective one on the Queen-side. White can produce a passed Pawn in the resulting ending, while Black cannot force a passed Pawn with his Pawn majority on the other side. Black has a Bishop pair as a compensation for his Pawn weakness, which he can put to good use in open position.

Capablanca was the World Chess Champion from 1921 to 1927. The Greatest compliment one can pay a master is to compare his play to Capablanca. He was a genius, the greatest ever produced by chess. See what other World Champions say about him :- 
"You cannot play chess unless you have studied his games." - Mikhail Botvinnik. 
"Capablanca was possibly the greatest player in the entire history of chess." - Bobby Fischer.
"Capablanca invariably chose the right option, no matter how intricate the position." Garry Kasparov.
The following is an impeccably played game by the Former World Champion, typical of his seemingly effortless simplicity.

Queen's Gambit Declined
"The man who never missed a combination." That was how Alekhine described the Dutch Grandmaster Dr. Max Euwe. In 1935, Euwe became the World Champion after he defeated Alekhine in their match. Dr. Euwe was the President of the World Chess Federation (F I D E) from 1970 to 1978. Though he lost his title to Alekhine in 1937, he became famous for his writings. His well-known book 'Judgment and Planning in Chess' is regarded as on of the standard manuals for developing players.

The legendary Mikhail Tal was the finest ever exponent of attacking chess. His all-out sacrificial style took him all the way to the World Championship title in 1960, when he defeated Botvinnik in the World title match. Though the eighth World Champion Tal lost the return match, his keenly combinational and uncompromising style won him a big number of fans in the chess world.

This is the Modern Benoni Defence. Here Black develops his Bishop on g7 by playing... g6 and the move... c5 gives Black control of the dark squares in the centre.

Not the best square for the Bishop. Better would have been 7. Nf3, 8.h3 and then placing the Bishop to d3 as per the latest theory.

Black puts pressure on the e - Pawn and also prevents its advance. Later Black plays on the Queenside for... b5,... b4 etc.

White plans to develop his Bishop to f4 before playing Nd2. As will be seen, Tal brilliantly refutes this idea. It looks better to play 10. Nd2 as recommended by theory.

Forced. Since after 14. Bd3 Nd3 15 Qd3 Be4 Black remains a Pawn up.
Black has compensation since he will get another Pawn on d5 with a tempo and also White pieces are in a cramped position. Practically it is difficult for White to find the best path.

Black is a Pawn up but the most important factor is that it provides a fine outpost for the Bishop in the centre.

{
White has placed all his Pawns on the light squares and avoids giving Black any target of attack. Now White is planning to exchange a pair of Rooks which will ease the pressure. Even after that the material on the board is enough for Tal to build up the decisive attack.

Queen's Gambit Declined
"Chess like music and love has the power to make men happy." 
- Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch.
Tarrasch was born club-footed on March 5, 1862 in Breslau. However, his physical deformity did not affect his play. His games are marvellous examples of strategy in the classical tradition, and the combinations that he played as a result of his careful planning are not flashy, but precise, economical and sound to the core. Thousands of experts owe their understanding of chess to Tarrasch.
Against von Scheve Tarrasch plans a course of play leading practically to mate, from so early a stage of the eighth move of the game! He forces an exchange of pawns leading to open 'g' file. After doubling of Rooks on this file, he moves his Queen to the Kingside. The way these heavy pieces attack the opponent's King is a good lesson in the Art of Attack.
