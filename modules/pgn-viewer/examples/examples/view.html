    {The development of chess was stimulated in the coffee houses. Philidor and\
        Stamma played in Old Slaughter (London 1747). Only the result is known (+8, =1,\
            -1). At the beginning of the nineteenth century it became possible to travel\
        from London to Paris within a week. Lewis travelled as a tourist to Paris. At\
        the Cafe de la Regence he played three games in four hours against\
        Deschappeles. Lewis got a pawn and the move in each game. Two games ended in a\
        draw. The decisive combination in game three follows.} \
